Nango is a single API to interact with all other external APIs. It should be the only API you need to integrate to your app.

# 👩‍💻 Sample code

Initiate a new OAuth flow from your frontend:

```js
nango.openConnectUI();
```

Get structured objects from external APIs from your backend:

```ts
nango.listRecords<GithubIssue>({
    providerConfigKey: 'github',
    connectionId: 'user123',
    model: 'GithubIssue',
});
```

# 🐻 History

Pizzly (a simple service for OAuth) was initially developed by the team at [Bearer](https://www.bearer.com/?ref=pizzly) with contributions of more than 40 individuals. Over time the focus of Bearer shifted and they could no longer maintain Pizzly. In late 2022 the team at [Nango](https://www.nango.dev) adopted the project and has since maintained and evolved it together with the growing Nango community.
