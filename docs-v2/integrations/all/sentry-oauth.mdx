## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Sentry account">
    1. If you don’t already have a Sentry account, go to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and sign up for a free account.
    2. Sign in to your Sentry account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new Nango integration">
    1. Navigate to **Integrations**, then click **Configure New Integration**.  
    2. Search for **Sentry (Public Integrations)** and select it.  
    3. You can leave the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields empty for now — you’ll fill them in later.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new Sentry integration">
    1. Naviagate to **Settings** > **Custom Integrations**.
    2. Click **Create New Integration** and select **Public Integration** then click **Next**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your integration">
    Fill in the required fields:
    1. **Name**: Enter a name for your integration (e.g., “My App Integration”).
    2. **Author**: The company or person who built and maintains this Integration.
    3. **Webhook URL**: You can find the specific **Webhook URL** on the integration page of the Nango integration you created earlier in Step 2.
    4. Under **PERMISSIONS**, configure the required scopes for your integration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Obtain your OAuth credentials">
    After saving your integration, you’ll receive:
    
    - **Client ID**
    - **Client Secret**
    
    These will be used when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your integration in Nango">
    Using the integration you created earlier within Nango, enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the previous step, then save your changes.
  </Step>


  <Step title="Submit for review (if publishing publicly)">
    1. Once your integration is ready for public use, ensure that you have a [valid](https://docs.sentry.io/organization/integrations/integration-platform/public-integration/#image-requirements) logo, navigate to **Settings** > **Custom Integrations**.
    2. Click **Publish** next to your integration.
    3. This will notify the Sentry team (via email) that your app is ready for review.
    
    Public integrations require review before being listed in the Sentry marketplace.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).

## API gotchas

- A partial connection is created when initiating the OAuth flow for a Sentry public integration in Nango. This connection remains in a pending state until the user manually accepts and installs the integration from the Sentry Public Integrations page (via the Accept & Install button).
