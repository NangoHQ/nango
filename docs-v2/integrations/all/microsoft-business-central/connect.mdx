# Overview

To authenticate with Microsoft Business Central, you need:
1. **Tenant ID** - The unique identifier for your organization that uses Microsoft services.
2. **Enrivonment Name** - The environment name to your organization.
3. **Client ID** - The unique identifier that Azure assigns to your application when it's registered.
4. **Client Secret** - A unique string that enables the client application to access Microsoft Business Central.

This guide will walk you through generating and finding these credentials within Azure and Microsoft Business Central.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an Azure account with an active Microsoft Business Central subscription.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding your Tenant ID
1. Your Tenant ID can be found in the **Tenant ID** field on the [Overview page](https://aad.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview) within your Azure account.

7. Set the redirect URI: **https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm**, then click **Configure**.


#### Step 4: Generating your Client Secret
1. After registering a new app in the [step](#step-3-generating-your-client-id) above, you can now generate a client secret for that specific application. Navigate to **Certificates & secrets** under **Manage**, and click **New client secret**.
2. A pop-up modal will appear, prompting you to enter your secret's **Description** and **Expires** values. Fill these then click on **Add**.

3. Once completed, your **Client Secret** will be generated. This value can be found in the **Value** field within the **Client Secrets** table.

4. After generating the **Client Secret**, you must grant the registered application the necessary permissions for **Dynamics 365 Business Central**. To do this, navigate to **API permissions**, select **Add a permission**, and choose **Dynamics 365 Business Central**.

5. Select **Application permissions**, choose the required permissions, and then click **Add permissions**.

6. Grant admin consent for the selected permission by choosing it from the list and then clicking **Grant admin consent for your specific tenant name**.

- After setting up the app above, we need to Configure service-to-service authentication for the Azure AD application in Business Central.
7. Login to your **Business Central** client, search for **Microsoft Entra Applications**, open the page, and click **New**.

8. In the opened screen, enter the **Application (Client) ID** to the **Client ID** field. This is the Azure AD application ID that you obtained at [step 2](#step-3-generating-your-client-id) above.
9. Fill in the **Description** field. If this application is set up by a partner, please enter sufficient partner-identifying information, so that all applications set up by this partner can be tracked in the future.
10. Set the **State** to **Enabled**.
11. Give a permission set or assign a user group.
12. (Optional) - If you didnÂ´t grant admin consent from Azure you can do it here as well by selecting **Grant Consent**.

Once you have your credentials:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Microsoft Business Central.
2. Enter the **Tenant ID**,  **Enrivonment Name**, **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in their designated fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
