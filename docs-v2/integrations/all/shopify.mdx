## Connection configuration in Nango

Shopify requires a user specific subdomain to run OAuth.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('shopify', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {subdomain: '<shopify-subdomain>'}});
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

- Shopify's API requires a shop-specific subdomain in the authorization URL.
- Access tokens are shop-specific and cannot be used across different shops.
- Some API endpoints have different rate limits than others. Check the [rate limits documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits) for details.
