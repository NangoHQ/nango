  <Tab title="🚀 Quickstart">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Shopify_.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Shopify">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Shopify. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Shopify API">
        Let's make your first request to the Shopify API (fetch a list of customers). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/admin/api/2025-01/customers.json?limit=10" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
                ```

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            const res = await nango.get({
                endpoint: '/admin/api/2025-01/customers.json',
                params: {
                  limit: 10
                },
                providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
                connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
            });

            console.log(JSON.stringify(res.data, null, 2));
            ```
            </Tab>

        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

      </Step>

  <Tab title="🚨 API gotchas">
    - Shopify's API requires a shop-specific subdomain in the authorization URL.
    - Access tokens are shop-specific and cannot be used across different shops.
    - Some API endpoints have different rate limits than others. Check the [rate limits documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits) for details.
