  <Tab title="🚀 Quickstart">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Greenhouse (Ingestion API)_. Nango doesn't provide a test OAuth app for Greenhouse (Ingestion API) yet, so you'll need to set up your own by following these [instructions](#🧑%E2%80%8D💻-oauth-app-setup). After that, make sure to add the OAuth Client ID, Client Secret, and scopes in the integration settings in Nango.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Greenhouse">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Greenhouse. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Greenhouse Ingestion API">
        Let's make your first request to the Greenhouse Ingestion API (fetch the profile of the currently signed-in user). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl -X GET "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/v1/partner/current_user" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
                ```
            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            const res = await nango.get({
              endpoint: '/v1/partner/current_user',
              providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
              connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
            });

            console.log(JSON.stringify(res.data, null, 2));
            ```
            </Tab>

        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.

    <Tip>
    Next step: [Embed the auth flow](/getting-started/quickstart/embed-in-your-app) in your app to let your users connect their Greenhouse accounts.

  <Tab title="🧑‍💻 OAuth app setup">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Submit application information to Greenhouse">
        Contact Greenhouse to register your OAuth application. You'll need to provide:
        - **Application Name**: The name of your application as it will appear in Greenhouse
        - **Application URL**: The URL of your application  
        - **Callback URL**: Use `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
        - **Logo Image**: A 128x128 pixel image for Greenhouse's permissions modal
      </Step>
      <Step title="Receive OAuth credentials from Greenhouse">
        After submitting your application information, Greenhouse will provide:
        - **Consumer Key**: Uniquely identifies your application
        - **Consumer Secret**: Acts as proof of your application's identity (will be encrypted when emailed)
        
        <Note>The consumer secret is confidential and will be encrypted by Greenhouse for security. They'll provide decryption instructions.</Note>
        After decrypting the secret, copy both the **Consumer Key** (which serves as the Client ID) and **Consumer Secret** (which serves as the Client Secret) as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
      </Step>
       <Step title="Next">
        Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
      </Step>
    </Steps>
