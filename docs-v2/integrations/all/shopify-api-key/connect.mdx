# Overview

To authenticate with Shopify, you will need:
1. **Shopify Domain** - The domain associated with your Shopify account.
2. **API Access Token** - The API access token generated after installing an app in your Shopify store.

This guide will walk you through finding your **Shopify Domain** and generating your **API Access Token** within Shopify.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an account with Shopify.
- Custom app development must be activated in your Shopify admin account.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding your Shopify Domain
1. Sign in to your [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) account.
2. Your **Shopify Domain** is the text found after the URL of your store in the address bar. For example, in `https://admin.shopify.com/store/6nzh0y-y6`, the domain is `6nzh0y-y6`.
3. You can also click on your profile in the top right corner, then select **All Stores** to view the list of stores associated with your account.

4. From the displayed list, your **Shopify Domain** is the value before `myshopify.com`.

#### Step 2: Generating Your API Access Token
- After you've [activated custom app development](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-types/custom-apps#enable-custom-app-development), you can create and install a custom app in your Shopify admin.

1. From your Shopify admin, go to **Settings** > [Apps and sales channels](https://admin.shopify.com/settings/apps).
2. Click **Develop apps**.

3. Click **Create a custom app**.
4. In the modal window, enter the **App name** and select an **App developer**. The app developer can be the store owner, or any staff or collaborator account with the **Develop apps** permission.

5. Click **Create app**.
- After you create a custom app, you can assign API scopes to it. A custom app can have **Admin API** scopes, **Storefront API** scopes, or both, depending on the requirements of the app. You need to select at least one scope before you install the app.
6. In the **Overview** tab, select at least a single scope from either **Admin** or **Storefront** API scopes, or both, depending on the app's requirements.

Once you have your **Shopify Domain** and **API Access Token**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Shopify (api key).
2. Enter the **Shopify Domain** and **API Access Token** in their respective fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
