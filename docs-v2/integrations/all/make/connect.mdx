# Overview

To authenticate with Make, you need the following information:

2. **Domain** - The domain of your Make account, typically your Make workspace URL.

This guide will walk you through finding or generating these credentials within Make.

### Prerequisites:
- You must have a Make account.

## Step 1: Generating an API Key

4. In the Add token dialog, do the following:
 Label: type a custom name for your token that will help you recognize what the token is used for
 Scopes: select the scopes you need for working with API resources.

5. Click Save.

## Step 2: Finding Your Domain
1. Identify your Make workspace domain. It typically appears as the subdomain of your account URL, for example:
https://your-workspace-name.make.com , **`your-workspace-name`** is the domain of your Make account.
2. Copy this domain name for use during the authentication process.

## Step 3: Connecting Your Make Account
To link your Make account:
1. Navigate to the Make authentication form in your application.
2. Enter the following details:
- **API Key**: Paste the key you generated in Step 1.
- **Domain**: Enter the domain of your Make account from Step 2.
3. Click **Connect** to complete the authentication process.
