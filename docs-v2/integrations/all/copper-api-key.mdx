## API gotchas

- Copper offers both OAuth and API_KEY authentication modes. To use OAuth2.0 with Copper, you must first register your application.

- To register your application, [contact](https://developer.copper.com/introduction/oauth/index.html#:~:text=To%20register%20your,all%20authorization%20flows.) copper.

- You will need to provide the name and purpose of your application as well as a URL to an HTTPS endpoint that will handle the secure callback.
You will receive two credentials, client_id and client_secret, required for all authorization flows.

- To generate an API token, in the Copper web app navigate to `System settings` > `Integrations` > `API Keys` and click the `GENERATE API KEY` button.
