## Setup guide

To get started with the Sentry integration:

1. Create a Sentry account if you don't have one
2. Generate an Auth Token with required scopes (see [Connect guide](/integrations/all/sentry/connect))
3. Configure your domain (e.g. sentry.io or region-specific like us.sentry.io)

## API gotchas
- Sentry offers both `Auth Tokens` and Basic Auth with `API Keys`(Deprecated) for authentication
- Sentry uses API_KEY auth mode with `authorization: Bearer <Auth Token>` in the request header
- Different regions use different domains (e.g. us.sentry.io for US)
- Rate limits vary by tier and endpoint
- Some API endpoints require specific token scopes to access
