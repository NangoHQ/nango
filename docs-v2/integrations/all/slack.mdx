  <Tab title="🚀 Quickstart">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Slack_.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Slack">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Slack. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Slack API">
        Let's make your first request to the Slack API (fetch a list of channels in a Slack team). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/conversations.list?limit=10" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
                ```

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            const res = await nango.get({
                endpoint: '/conversations.list',
                params: { limit: 10 },
                providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
                connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
            });

            console.log(res.data);
            ```
            </Tab>


        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.

    <Tip>
    Next step: [Embed the auth flow](/getting-started/quickstart/embed-in-your-app) in your app to let your users connect their Slack accounts.
    </Tip>

  <Tab title="🧑‍💻 OAuth app setup">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a developer account">
        Go to [Slack Developer Program signup page](https://api.slack.com/developer-program) and click Join the Program.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create & configure a Slack app">
        Start creating a Slack app by clicking on the _Your Apps_ button then _Create New App_.

        Choose how you'd like to configure your app's scopes and settings. You can do this using a manifest file or starting from scratch.

        After choosing how you'd like to configure your app, add your app's name and pick a workspace to develop your app in.

        In the _Basic Information_ tab, copy/paste your app's `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, you will need to specify it in Nango later on.
        </Step>

        <Step title="Set up the OAuth scopes">

        In the _OAuth & Permissions_ tab, configure the following Redirect URL: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.

        Still in the _OAuth & Permissions_ tab, under _Scopes_, add the scopes that are relevant to how you want to consume Slack's API.

        There are 2 types of scopes, `Bot Token Scopes` and `User Token Scopes`. Bot tokens represent a bot associated with an app installed in a workspace. They govern what your app can access. They will be added to Nango when creating a Slack integration.

        User Token Scopes access user data and act on behalf of users that authorize them. They will be added to Nango when creating a Slack connection.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create a Slack Developer Sandbox">
        If you don't have a Slack Developer Sandbox already, head over to Slack's [Developer Program dashboard](https://api.slack.com/developer-program/dashboard) and provision one to test your integration.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Next">
        Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
