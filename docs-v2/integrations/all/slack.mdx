## Setup guide
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a developer account">
    Go to [Slack Developer Program signup page](https://api.slack.com/developer-program) and click Join the Program. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create & configure a Slack app">
    Start creating a Slack app by clicking on the _Your Apps_ button then _Create New App_.

    Choose how you'd like to configure your app's scopes and settings. You can do this using a manifest file or starting from scratch. 
    
    After choosing how you'd like to configure your app, add your app's name and pick a workspace to develop your app in.

    In the _Basic Information_ tab, copy/paste your app's `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, you will need to specify it in Nango later on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Set up the OAuth scopes">

    In the _OAuth & Permissions_ tab, configure the following Redirect URL: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.

    Still in the _OAuth & Permissions_ tab, under _Scopes_, add the scopes that are relevant to how you want to consume Slack's API.

    There are 2 types of scopes, `Bot Token Scopes` and `User Token Scopes`. Bot tokens represent a bot associated with an app installed in a workspace. They govern what your app can access. They will be added to Nango when creating a Slack integration.
    
    User Token Scopes access user data and act on behalf of users that authorize them. They will be added to Nango when creating a Slack connection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Slack Developer Sandbox">
    If you don't have a Slack Developer Sandbox already, head over to Slack's [Developer Program dashboard](https://api.slack.com/developer-program/dashboard) and provision one to test your integration. 
  </Step>

  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
