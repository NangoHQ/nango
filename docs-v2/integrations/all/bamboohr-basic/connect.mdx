# Overview

To authenticate with BambooHR (Basic Auth), you will need:
1. **Subdomain** - The subdomain used to access your BambooHR account.
2. **API Key** - A key that grants Nango permission to interact with BambooHR APIs resources and services.


This guide will walk you through generating or finding both the API Key and subdomain within BambooHR.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a registered account with BambooHR.
- Sufficient permission to view the **API Keys**.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding Your subdomain
1. **Log in** to your BambooHR account.
2. Check the URL in your browserâ€™s address bar. Your **Subdomain** is the text that appears after `https://` and before `.bamboohr.com`.
- For example, if the URL is `https://nango.bamboohr.com/home`, your **Subdomain** is `nango`.

#### Step 2: Finding Your API Key
1. **Log in** to your BambooHR account and click on **My Account** in the bottom-left corner.  
2. From the menu that appears, select **API Keys** to view existing keys or add new ones.
