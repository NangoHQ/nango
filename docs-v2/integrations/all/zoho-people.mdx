  <Tab title="🚀 Quickstart">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Zoho_.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Zoho People">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Zoho People. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Zoho People API">
        Let's make your first request to the Zoho People API (retrieves basic organizational information). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">
                ```bash
                curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/api/v3/organization" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
                ```
            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            const res = await nango.get({
                endpoint: '/api/v3/organization',
                providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
                connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
            });
            console.log(res.data);
            ```
            </Tab>

        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.

    <Tip>
    Next step: [Embed the auth flow](/getting-started/quickstart/embed-in-your-app) in your app to let your users connect their Jira accounts.

  <Tab title="🚨 API gotchas">
  - Zoho uses datacenter-specific URLs for authentication. Make sure to use the correct datacenter domain extension (`com`, `eu`, `in`, `com.cn`, `com.au`) based on where your user's account is registered.
  - For production applications, consider implementing [multi-datacenter support](https://www.zoho.com/accounts/protocol/oauth/multi-dc.html) to handle users from different regions.
  - For specific scopes, refer to the API documentation pages to find the exact scopes needed per API and per method. 
  - Zoho People requires a partnership to deploy to production.
