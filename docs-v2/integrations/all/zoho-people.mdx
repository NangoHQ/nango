## Connection configuration in Nango

- Zoho People uses [different domain extensions](https://www.zoho.com/people/api/oauth-steps.html#step3) for different regions.

You need to pass the domain extension to use to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('zoho-people', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {extension: 'com'}});
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas
- You can make your OAuth app cross-data-centers with [these instructions](https://www.zoho.com/accounts/protocol/oauth/multi-dc.html#:~:text=Steps%20to%20enable%20Multi%20DC%20support&text=Go%20to%20the%20Settings%20tab,have%20a%20unique%20client%20secret). This allows a single OAuth app to query the Zoho People API across different data centers, such as those in the US, EU, and other regions.
