    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _LinkedIn_.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize LinkedIn">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to LinkedIn. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the LinkedIn API">
        Let's make your first request to the LinkedIn API (fetch the current member's profile). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/v2/userinfo" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
                ```

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            const res = await nango.get({
                endpoint: '/v2/userinfo',
                providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
                connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
            });

            console.log(res.data);
            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

  <Tab title="🧑‍💻 OAuth app setup">
   <Steps>
  <Step title="Create a developer account">
    Go to [LinkedIn's developer signup page](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/) and create an account. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create & configure a LinkedIn app">
    1. Start creating a LinkedIn app by clicking on the **Create app** button. 
    2. Fill out the app creation form with the following details:
       - **App name** (required): Enter your app name.
       - **LinkedIn Page** (required): Enter your company's name or LinkedIn Company Page URL (e.g., https://www.linkedin.com/company/...)
         - For Third Party/Enterprise Developers: Select a LinkedIn Company Page that will be associated with your app.
         - For Individual Developers: Select the default Company page associated with your API products.
       - **Privacy policy URL**: Enter a URL beginning with http:// or https://
       - **App logo** (required): Upload a square logo image (recommended: at least 100px in one dimension).
       - **Legal agreement** (required): Check "I have read and agree to these terms".

     4. In the **Auth** tab, configure the following Redirect URL: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`, then copy both the `Client ID` and `Primary Client Secret`, you will need them when configuring your integration in Nango.

  <Tab title="🚨 API gotchas">
-   If the scope permissions are changed in your app, your users must re-authenticate to ensure that they have explicitly granted your application all of the permissions that it is requesting on their behalf.
-   The scopes available to your app depend on which Products or Partner Programs your app has access to.
-   In order to receive refresh tokens for your connections you must request the "Advertising API" product in your app under the "Products" tab on LinkedIn. This also requires your app to be verified which can be done by your LinkedIn page admin.
