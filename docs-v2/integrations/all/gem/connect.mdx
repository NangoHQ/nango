# Overview

To authenticate with Gem, you need:
1. **Shareable Access Key** - A key that grants Nango permission to interact with Gem's APIs resources and services.

This guide will walk you through obtaining your **Shareable Access Key** within Gem.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an account with Gem.
- The API must be enabled for your account before you can generate **API keys**. To request access, reach out to your Gem point of contact (Customer Success Manager or Account Executive).
- You have already configured the `appSecret` in the **connection configuration**, which was provided externally by Gem when creating a [session](https://docs.nango.dev/reference/api/connect/sessions/create#body-integrations-config-defaults-key-connection-config)

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding Your Shareable Access Key
1. Log in to your [Gem](https://www.gem.com/login) account.
2. Select your profile at the bottom left then navigate to **Admin Settings** > **Integrations**.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page to find **Third party applications** section.
4. Click **Add Integration** to add your integration and copy the **Shareable Access Key**.
