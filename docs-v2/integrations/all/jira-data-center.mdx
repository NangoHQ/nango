## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up Jira Data Center">
    1. Ensure you have a running Jira Data Center instance. If not, you can:
       - [Start a free trial](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/data-center/free-trial)
       - [Install Jira Data Center](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/installing-jira-data-center-938846870.html)
    2. Make sure you have administrator privileges on your Jira Data Center instance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an incoming link">
    1. Log in to your Jira Data Center instance as an administrator.
    2. Navigate to **Administration** > **Applications** > **Application links**.
    3. Select **Create link**.
    4. Select **External application** and then choose **Incoming** as the direction.
    5. Fill in the details as described in the sections below.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide application details">
    In the application details section:
    
    1. Enter a descriptive name for your application.
    2. For the **Redirect URL**, enter `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
    
    Note: This is the URL where users will be redirected after authorizing your application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure application permissions">
    Select the appropriate permission scopes for your integration:
    
    - **READ**: View projects and issues the user can view, including related items like dashboards, filters, attachments, or comments.
    - **WRITE**: Create, update, and delete projects and issues the user can change, including related items.
    - **ADMIN**: Perform most administrative functions on the entire Jira instance.
    - **SYSTEM_ADMIN**: Perform all administrative functions on the entire Jira instance.
    
    Note: Choose only the scopes your application needs. Higher-level scopes automatically include lower-level ones (e.g., WRITE includes READ).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain OAuth credentials">
    1. After creating the incoming link, you'll receive your OAuth credentials:
       - **Client ID**: The identifier for your application
       - **Client Secret**: The secret key for your application
    
    2. Store these credentials securely as you'll need them to configure your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your integration in Nango">
    When setting up your Jira Data Center integration in Nango:
    
    - Use your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the previous step
    - For the authorization URL, use: `https://[your-jira-instance]/rest/oauth2/latest/authorize`
    - For the token URL, use: `https://[your-jira-instance]/rest/oauth2/latest/token`
    - Replace `[your-jira-instance]` with your actual Jira Data Center instance URL
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the OAuth flow">
    1. After configuring your integration in Nango, test the OAuth flow to ensure it works correctly.
    2. The authorization flow will redirect users to Jira where they can approve access to their account.
    3. After approval, users will be redirected back to your application with an authorization code.
    4. This code will be exchanged for access and refresh tokens.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>
