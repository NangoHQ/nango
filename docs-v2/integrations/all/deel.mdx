## API gotchas

-   Deel provides a separate environment for testing/sandbox and production. We have also provided two different providers for this purpose. Hence, to create an integration for the sandbox, use `deel-sandbox` and for production use `deel`.

<Note>Add Getting Started links and Gotchas by [editing this page](https://github.com/nangohq/nango/tree/master/docs-v2/integrations/all/deel.mdx)</Note>
