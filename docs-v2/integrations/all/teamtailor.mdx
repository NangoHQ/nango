## API gotchas

- Teamtailor uses API_KEY auth mode with Authorization: Token token=`api_key` in the request header to access different endpoints.
- The rate limit allows for a maximum of 50 requests per 10 seconds.
- All API calls must have `X-Api-Version` as a header to resolve API versions.
- Teamtailor uses different domain extensions for different regions, i.e `na` for US West(Oregon) Hosted Customers. For EU(Ireland) based clients, add `api` as your extension but for US West(Oregon) based customers add `api.na` as your extension.
