  <Tab title="🚀 Quickstart">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Google Analytics_. Nango doesn't provide a test OAuth app for Google Analytics yet. You’ll need to set up your own by following these [instructions](#🧑%E2%80%8D💻-oauth-app-setup). After that, make sure to add the OAuth client ID, secret, and scopes in the integration settings in Nango.

      <Note>
        Nango has credentials you can use for testing. Activate them in the dashboard.
      </Note>

      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Google Analytics">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Google Analytics. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Google Analytics API">
        Let's make your first request to the Google Analytics Admin API (fetch a list of accounts). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/v1beta/accounts?pageSize=10" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Base-Url-Override: https://analyticsadmin.googleapis.com" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
                ```

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            const res = await nango.get({
                endpoint: '/v1beta/accounts',
                params: {
                  pageSize: 10
                },
                providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
                connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>',
                // Base Override here as we are accessing the Admin Rest API
                // https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/admin/v1/rest/v1beta/accounts/list
                baseUrlOverride: 'https://analyticsadmin.googleapis.com',
            });

            console.log(res.data);
            ```
            </Tab>


        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.

    <Tip>
    Next step: [Embed the auth flow](/getting-started/quickstart/embed-in-your-app) in your app to let your users connect their Google Analytics accounts.

  <Tab title="🧑‍💻 OAuth app setup">

    <Info>
      You will need to pass a security review to go live with your integration.

      [Follow our guide](/integrations/google-security-review) to get approved as fast as possible.

    ## Create your OAuth App
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a Google Cloud account">
        If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create a new project">
        1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
        2. Click on the project dropdown at the top left of the page.
        3. Click **New Project**.
        4. Enter a **Project Name** for your project.
        5. Under **Location**, select the appropriate organization or folder where this project should belong.
        <Note>If you're not part of an organization, it will default to No organization</Note>
        6. Click **Create** and wait for the project to be created.
        7. Select it from the project dropdown.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Enable the APIs you need">
        1. Go to the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) in the Google Cloud Console.
        2. Search for **Google Analytics API** and select the APIs you wish to integrate with, such as **Google Analytics Admin API**, **Analytics Hub API**, etc., then click **Enable** for each.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure the OAuth consent screen">
        1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen** in the Google Cloud Console.
        2. Click **Get started**.
        3. Fill in all the required fields in the **App Information** form.
        4. Click **Next**. Select the appropriate Audience:
           - **External**: For applications available to any Google user
           - **Internal**: For applications restricted to users within your Google Workspace organization
        5. Click **Next**. Fill in the **Contact Information**; these are the email addresses that Google will use to notify you about any changes to your project.
        6. Click **Next**, then check the **I agree to the Google API Services: User Data Policy** checkbox, and click **Continue**.
        7. Add the scopes your application needs. Under **Data Access**, click **Add or Remove Scopes** and select the scopes that correspond to the APIs you enabled.
        8. Under **Audience**, click **Add users** if you selected **External** user type (required for testing before verification).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create OAuth 2.0 credentials">
        1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** in the Google Cloud Console.
        2. Click **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
        3. Select **Web application** as the application type.
        4. Enter a name for your OAuth client.
        5. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
        6. Click **Create**.
        7. A dialog will appear with your client ID and client secret. Save these credentials securely as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Start building your integration">
        Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to build your integration.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify your app">
       Most Google Analytics scopes are marked "sensitive" by Google.

       You can develop your integration in test mode, but you need to pass a security review to go live.

       [Follow our guide](/integrations/google-security-review) to prepare and pass as quickly as possible.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Publish your app (switch from Testing to Production)">
        To move your OAuth app from testing to production:
        1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen** > **Audience**.
        2. Click **Publish App** to switch your app from testing to production.
      </Step>

    </Steps>
