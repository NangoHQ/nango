## API gotchas

-   To get refresh token, you will need to add **`offline_access`** to the list of your scopes.
-   You can find permissions required for each API call in their corresponding API methods section.
-   You can set the [`.default` scope documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#default-when-the-user-gives-consent) to ensure the permissions remain the same as those granted at the organization level.
-   If you require a user to reauthenticate and force them to accept scopes that have been updated or changed you can force a prompt via the `authorization_params`:

```typescript
const { data } = await nango.createConnectSession({
  [...],
  integrations_config_defaults: {
    "outlook": {
      authorization_params: {
        "prompt": "consent"
      }
    }
  }
});
```
