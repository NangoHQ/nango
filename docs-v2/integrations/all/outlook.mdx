  <Tab title="🚀 Quickstart">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Outlook_. Nango doesn't provide a test OAuth app for Outlook yet. You’ll need to set up your own by following these [instructions](#🧑%E2%80%8D💻-oauth-app-setup). After that, make sure to add the OAuth client ID, secret, and scopes in the integration settings in Nango.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Outlook">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Outlook. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Outlook API">
        Let's make your first request to the Outlook (Microsoft Graph) API (fetch the profile of the currently signed-in user). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/v1.0/me" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
                ```

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            const res = await nango.get({
                endpoint: '/v1.0/me',
                providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
                connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
            });

            console.log(res.data);
            ```
            </Tab>

        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.

    Next step: [Embed the auth flow](/getting-started/quickstart/embed-in-your-app) in your app to let your users connect their Outlook accounts.

  <Tab title="🧑‍💻 OAuth app setup">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a Microsoft account and Azure account">
        If you don't already have them, sign up for a [Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/account) and an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID">
        1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an Application Developer.
        2. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the Settings icon in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application.
        3. From the search bar at the top of the Azure portal, search for **App registrations** and select it. Then choose **New registration**. Or from your left navigation tab, navigate to **Applications** > **App registrations** then choose **New registration**.
        4. Enter a meaningful name for your application, for example "Nango Integration".
        5. Under **Supported account types** you need to decide who can install your integration:
           - **Accounts in any organizational directory** - Any user account in a professional Microsoft organization (Business, School, etc.)
           - **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts** - The accounts from the first option, plus personal Microsoft accounts (pick this unless you want to restrict your integration to business accounts)
        6. Leave the **Redirect URI** section blank for now; we'll configure it in a later step.
        7. Click **Register** to complete the app registration.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Note your application (client) ID">
        After registration, you'll be taken to the application's Overview page. Record the **Application (client) ID**, which uniquely identifies your application and is used in your application's code as part of validating security tokens.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add a redirect URI">
        1. In the left sidebar, select **Authentication**.
        2. Under **Platform configurations**, select **Add a platform**.
        3. Select **Web** as the platform type.
        4. Enter `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` as the Redirect URI.
        5. Under **Advanced settings**, keep **Allow public client flows** set to the default **No** for web applications.
        6. Click **Configure** to save your changes.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add API permissions">
        1. In the left sidebar, select **API permissions**.
        2. Click **Add a permission**.
        3. Select **Microsoft Graph** to integrate with **Outlook**.
        4. Select the required permissions from the **Delegated permissions section**.
        5. Select the specific permissions your app requires. Please refer to the table below for some of the [commonly used scopes](#common-scopes).
        6. Click **Add permissions**.
        7. If your application requires admin consent, click **Grant admin consent for [tenant]** to pre-authorize the permissions.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create a client secret">
        1. In the left sidebar, select **Certificates & secrets**.
        2. Under **Client secrets**, click **New client secret**.
        3. Enter a description for the secret and select an expiration period (6 months, 12 months, 24 months, or custom). Please select a date further in the future to avoid interruptions. Note that the **Custom** date can only be set to a maximum of 1 year from the current date. If the secret expires, you will need to regenerate a new one and update your integration within Nango.
        4. Click **Add**.
        5. **Important**: Copy the secret value immediately and store it securely. You won't be able to see it again after you leave this page.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure token settings (optional)">
        1. In the left sidebar, select **Token configuration**. Here you can configure optional claims to be included in the access tokens issued for your application.
        2. Click **Add optional claim** and select the claims you want to include in your access tokens.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure app visibility (optional)">
        If you want users to see your app on their My Apps page:

        1. From the search bar at the top of the Azure portal, search for **Enterprise applications**, select it, and then choose your app.
        2. On the **Properties** page, set **Visible to users?** to **Yes**.
