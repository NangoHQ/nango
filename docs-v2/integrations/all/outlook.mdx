## API gotchas

-   To get refresh token, you will need to add **`offline_access`** to the list of your scopes.
-   You can find permissions required for each API call in their corresponding API methods section.
-   If you are developing an app for users within your own organization and the app has already been granted adequate permissions at the organization level with user consent turned off, you must override the integration config when calling the create connect session method:
    - Override `authorization_params` by setting only `response_type: code` to remove the consent screen (this removes both `response_mode` and `prompt`).
    - Set the scopes to [`.default`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#the-default-scope) to ensure the permissions remain the same as those granted at the organization level.

```typescript
const { data } = await nango.createConnectSession({
  [...],
  integrations_config_defaults: {
    "outlook": {
      authorization_params: {
        response_type: 'code'
      },
      default_scopes: '.default'
    }
  }
});
```

If this is not done, the app will [show a consent screen prompting the user to grant permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#example-1-the-user-or-tenant-admin-has-granted-permissions) which the user will be unable to do without admin access.
