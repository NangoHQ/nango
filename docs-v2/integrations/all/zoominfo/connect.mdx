# Overview
To authenticate with ZoomInfo, you need two key pieces of information:
1. **Client ID** - A unique identifier for your application on ZoomInfo.
2. **Private Key** - A secret key that is used to generate a JWT.

This guide will walk you through finding or creating those credentials within ZoomInfo.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an account with ZoomInfo with administrator access.

#### Step 1: Finding Your Client ID and Private Key
1. Log into your admin ZoomInfo account and navigate to `Admin Portal` > `API` and click `Generate New Key`.
    This will provide you with a `Client ID` and a `Private Key`.

#### Step 2: Connect Your ZoomInfo Account

Click "Connect" to complete the authentication.
