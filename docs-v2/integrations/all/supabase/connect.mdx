# Overview

To authenticate with Supabase, you need the following:
1. **Project URL** - The unique project reference URL for your Supabase project
2. **API Key** - The anon or service_role API key for your Supabase project

This guide will walk you through finding those credentials within Supabase.

## Prerequisites
- You must have administrative access to your Supabase project.
- Ensure you have permission to generate and manage API keys.

3. Use the `service_role` key for admin access, or `anon` for public access. 
The anon key is safe to use in a browser if Row Level Security is enabled for your tables 
and configured policies, while the service_role key has the ability to bypass Row Level Security.
