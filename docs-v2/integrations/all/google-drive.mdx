## Pre-built Google Drive Integration Overview

Nango's pre-built Google Drive integration allows you to sync specific files and folders that your users select. The integration uses the following components:

1. **OAuth Flow**: Handle authentication using Nango's SDK
2. **Google Drive Picker**: Let users select files and folders to sync
3. **Document Sync**: Sync metadata for selected files and folders
4. **Document Fetching**: Download individual file contents as needed

### Complete Implementation Guide

The easiest way to implement Google Drive integration is to use the [Nango Sample App](https://github.com/NangoHQ/sample-app) as your starting point. The sample app provides a complete, production-ready implementation that you can customize for your needs.

You can watch a [Loom video walkthrough of the sample app](https://www.loom.com/share/2fffe840faa141ceb355d5d6aaab2f75) if you prefer.

### Requirements

- Docker (desktop) installed & running
- NodeJS & NPM installed
- A Nango account (sign up at [nango.dev](https://nango.dev))

### Install & Run Instructions (~10 min)

1. Clone the sample app repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NangoHQ/sample-app.git
    cd sample-app
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the app:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

    <Note>
    You should see `[back] Listening on http://0.0.0.0:3010` in the end.
    If this doesn't show, kill the process with Ctrl + C and run `npm run start` again. Sometimes the docker database takes a bit longer to start up.
    </Note>

3. Expose the app to the internet:
    ```bash
    npm run webhooks-proxy
    ```
    This should print an output similar to: `your url is: https://cute-zebras-hug.loca.lt`

    <Note>
    If you experience any troubles with this we recommend using ngrok and you need to expose the URL http://localhost:3010:
    ```bash
    ngrok http 3010
    ```
    </Note>

4. Configure Nango webhooks:
    - Copy the URL from the previous step
    - Go to [Environment Settings](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings) in Nango
    - Set the **primary Webhook URL** to `${URL}/webhooks-from-nango`
    - Example: `https://tame-socks-warn.loca.lt/webhooks-from-nango`

    <img src="/images/google-drive/webhook-url.png" alt="Nango Environment Settings page showing webhook URL configuration" />

5. Access the sample app:
    - Open [http://localhost:3011](http://localhost:3011/)
    - Click on "Files" to start the Google Drive integration

    <img src="/images/google-drive/sample-app-home.png" alt="Sample app home page with Files section highlighted" />

6. Connect your Google Drive account:
    - Click on the "Import from Google Drive" button
    - In the connect popup, click on the "Connect" button
    - Select your Google Drive account and authorize the app
    - Click on the "Finish" button to close the modal.

    - A modal will appear with the files and folders you can choose from.
    - Select the files and folders you want to sync.
    - Click on the "Select" button to close the modal.

    <img src="/images/google-drive/select-files.png" alt="Select files and folders from Google Drive" />

8. The files and folders will be synced to your Nango account and displayed in the UI.

9. Download a file:
    - Click on the "Download" button to download the file.
    - The file will be downloaded to your computer.

10. Disconnect your Google Drive account:
    - Click on the "Disconnect" button to disconnect your Google Drive account.

### What Happens Under the Hood

The sample app uses Nango to:

1. **Authentication**
   - Authenticate users with Google Drive
   - Show the Google Drive picker
   - Handle OAuth flow automatically


2. **File Syncing**
   - Sync selected files & folders
   - Initial sync on selection
   - Periodic updates

   <img src="/images/google-drive/sync-status.png" alt="Nango dashboard showing sync status and file list" />

3. **File Download**
   - Download raw file content
   - Handle different file types
   - Use Nango's proxy for reliable downloads

### Key Components

#### Frontend Implementation

1. **Authorization Flow**
   The authorization process is implemented in [`front-end/src/api.ts`](https://github.com/NangoHQ/sample-app/blob/main/front-end/src/api.ts):
   - `postConnectSession`: Initiates the OAuth connection
   - `getNangoCredentials`: Retrieves credentials after successful authorization

   The flow works as follows:
   1. Frontend initiates connection via `postConnectSession`
   2. Backend creates a Nango connection session
   3. User is redirected to Google OAuth consent screen
   4. After authorization, user is redirected back to the app
   5. Frontend can fetch credentials using `getNangoCredentials`

#### Backend Implementation

1. **Webhook Handler & Data Sync**
   The webhook handling and data sync logic is implemented in [`back-end/src/routes/postWebhooks.ts`](https://github.com/NangoHQ/sample-app/blob/main/back-end/src/routes/postWebhooks.ts):

   Key components:
   - Main webhook handler that verifies signatures and routes requests
   - `handleNewConnectionWebhook`: Processes new Google Drive connections
   - `handleSyncWebhook`: Handles sync completion and data processing

   The sync process:
   1. Nango syncs files from Google Drive
   2. Webhook notifies backend of sync completion
   3. Backend fetches records using `nango.listRecords`
   4. File metadata is stored in the database
   5. Deletions are tracked and handled appropriately

2. **File Download with Proxy**
   File download functionality is implemented in [`back-end/src/routes/downloadFile.ts`](https://github.com/NangoHQ/sample-app/blob/main/back-end/src/routes/downloadFile.ts):

   The download process:
   1. Frontend requests file download with file ID and connection ID
   2. Backend uses Nango proxy to fetch file from Google Drive
   3. File is streamed to client with proper headers
   4. Error handling ensures graceful failure

   Key features:
   - Uses Nango proxy for secure file access
   - Proper content type and disposition headers
   - Streaming response for efficient file transfer
   - Comprehensive error handling

#### Integration Flow

1. **Authorization Flow**:
   - Frontend initiates OAuth via `postConnectSession` ([`front-end/src/api.ts`](https://github.com/NangoHQ/sample-app/blob/main/front-end/src/api.ts))
   - User authorizes access to Google Drive
   - Backend receives webhook for new connection ([`back-end/src/routes/postWebhooks.ts`](https://github.com/NangoHQ/sample-app/blob/main/back-end/src/routes/postWebhooks.ts))
   - Initial sync is triggered automatically

2. **Data Sync Flow**:
   - Nango syncs files from Google Drive
   - Webhook notifies backend of sync completion
   - Backend processes records and updates database
   - File metadata is stored for later access

3. **File Download Flow**:
   - Frontend requests file download
   - Backend uses Nango proxy to fetch file ([`back-end/src/routes/downloadFile.ts`](https://github.com/NangoHQ/sample-app/blob/main/back-end/src/routes/downloadFile.ts))
   - File is streamed to client
   - Proper error handling ensures reliability

- **Google Docs**
- **Google Sheets**
- **Google Slides**
- **Other Google Workspace files**

The implementation handles file type conversion and downloading automatically.
