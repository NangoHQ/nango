## Pre-built Google Drive integration
Nango's pre-built Google drive integration only syncs whitelisted files & folders. You can use the [Google Drive Picker](https://developers.google.com/drive/picker/guides/overview) to let the customer pick files & folders to sync.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Auth & Show Google Drive Picker">
    Scope to set in Nango: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`

    In your frontend, run the OAuth flow with `nango.auth` and show the Google drive picker to your user.

    Example code:
    ```js
    const ingest = async () => {
        let filesIds: string[] = [];      
        
        const cid = generateCid(); // generate a unique id for the connection

        try {
        const nangoAuth = await nango.auth('google-drive', cid);
        if (nangoAuth.connectionId) {
            filesIds = await openGooglePicker();
            if(filesIds.length === 0) {
            return;
            }
        }
        } catch (error) {
            // deal with error
        }
    }

    const openGooglePicker = async (): Promise<string[]> => {
        return new Promise<string[]>((resolve, reject) => {
        openPicker({
            appId: <GOOGLE_APP_ID>, // essential for keeping same file id between nango and your app
            clientId: <GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>,
            developerKey: <GOOGLE_PICKER_API_KEY>,
            viewId: 'DOCS',
            showUploadView: true,
            showUploadFolders: true,
            supportDrives: true,
            multiselect: true,
            setIncludeFolders: true,
            setSelectFolderEnabled: true,
            callbackFunction: (data) => {
            if (data.action === 'cancel') {
                handleCancel();
                resolve([]);
                return;
            }
            else if (data.action == 'picked') {
                const fileIds = data.docs.map((doc) => doc.id);
                resolve(fileIds);
            }
            }
        });
        });
    };
  ```
  Placeholders:
  - `<GOOGLE_APP_ID>` is your App id. [How to find your app id](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40638063)
  - `<GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>` is the client id of your Google OAuth app
  - `<GOOGLE_PICKER_API_KEY>` is the api key for your [Google Picker API](https://developers.google.com/drive/picker/guides/overview)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Push file & folder IDs to Nango">
    Pass the user selected file & folder IDs to your backend.

    From there, call the [Nango SDK](https://docs.nango.dev/reference/sdks/node#edit-connection-metadata) or [REST API](https://docs.nango.dev/reference/api/connection/update-metadata) to store the id's on the user's connection (SDK example):
    ```ts
    await nango.updateMetadata(
        'google-drive',
        'CONNECTION-ID',
        {
            'folders': ['abc', 'def', '<folder-ids>'],
            'files': ['<file>', '<ids>', '<here>'] 
        }
    );
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-trigger the sync">
    Re-trigger the sync in the dashboard, or with the API or node SDK. File metadata should get synced.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API gotchas

- Almost all Google drive scopes are ["restricted scopes"](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/production-readiness/restricted-scope-verification) by Google. This means your app needs to pass a security review with Google, before you can go live with users.
    - The only exception is the `drive.file` scope. It lets your app access files & folders the user has previously authorized with the Google Drive Picker API.
