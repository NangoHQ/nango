## Pre-built Google Drive Integration Overview

Nango's pre-built Google Drive integration allows you to sync specific files and folders that your users select. The integration uses the following components:

1. **OAuth Flow**: Handle authentication using Nango's SDK
2. **Google Drive Picker**: Let users select files and folders to sync
3. **Document Sync**: Sync metadata for selected files and folders
4. **Document Fetching**: Download individual file contents as needed

## Complete Implementation Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Initial Setup">
    Prerequisites
    Before getting started, ensure you have:
    - A Google Cloud project with Drive API enabled
    - Google Drive Picker API enabled
    - Required credentials:
        - Google App ID
        - OAuth Client ID
        - Picker API Key
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Configure OAuth & Drive Picker">
    Set the following scope in your Nango configuration:
    ```
        https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file
    ```

In your frontend, run the OAuth flow with `nango.auth` and show the Google drive picker to your user.

    ```js
        const ingest = async () => {
            let filesIds: string[] = [];

            const cid = generateCid(); // generate a unique id for the connection

            try {
            const nangoAuth = await nango.auth('google-drive', cid);
            if (nangoAuth.connectionId) {
                filesIds = await openGooglePicker();
                if(filesIds.length === 0) {
                    return;
                }
            }
            } catch (error) {
                // deal with error
            }
        }

        const openGooglePicker = async (): Promise<string[]> => {
            return new Promise<string[]>((resolve, reject) => {
                openPicker({
                    appId: <GOOGLE_APP_ID>, // essential for keeping same file id between nango and your app
                    clientId: <GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>,
                    developerKey: <GOOGLE_PICKER_API_KEY>,
                    viewId: 'DOCS',
                    showUploadView: true,
                    showUploadFolders: true,
                    supportDrives: true,
                    multiselect: true,
                    setIncludeFolders: true,
                    setSelectFolderEnabled: true,
                    callbackFunction: (data) => {
                        if (data.action === 'cancel') {
                            handleCancel();
                            resolve([]);
                            return;
                        }
                        else if (data.action == 'picked') {
                            const fileIds = data.docs.map((doc) => doc.id);
                            resolve(fileIds);
                        }
                    }
                });
            });
        };
    ```

    Note: Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials:
    - `<GOOGLE_APP_ID>`: Your Google Cloud project number
    - `<GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>` is the client id of your Google OAuth app
    - `<GOOGLE_PICKER_API_KEY>`: Your Drive Picker API key
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Update Connection Metadata">
    After users select files/folders, update the connection metadata using the Nango SDK:

    ```javascript
        // Using Nango SDK
        await nango.updateMetadata(
            'google-drive',
            connectionId,
            {
                'folders': ['folder-id-1', 'folder-id-2'],
                'files': ['file-id-1', 'file-id-2']
            }
        );
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Trigger Document Sync">
    Re-trigger the sync in the dashboard, or with the API to fetch metadata for selected files:

    ```js
    // Using Nango SDK
    await nango.triggerSync('google-drive', connectionId, 'documents');
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="5. Fetch Individual Files">
    To download specific files, use the appropriate action based on file type:

    ```js
    // Using Nango SDK
    // For regular files (PDFs, images, etc.)
    await nango.triggerAction('google-drive', connectionId, 'fetch-document', {
        id: fileId
    });

    // For Google Docs
    await nango.triggerAction('google-docs', connectionId, 'fetch-document', {
        id: fileId
    });

    // For Google Sheets
    await nango.triggerAction('google-sheets', connectionId, 'fetch-document', {
        id: fileId
    });

    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

You can find a complete implementation in the [Nango Sample App](https://github.com/NangoHQ/sample-app)

## File Type Support

The integration supports different file types through specific actions:

- **Regular files** (PDFs, images, etc.): Use `google-drive` provider with `fetch-document` action
- **Google Docs**: Use `google-docs` provider with `fetch-document` action
- **Google Sheets**: Use `google-sheets` provider with `fetch-document` action

Note: The same OAuth credentials work across all these providers.

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Empty Records**: If `/documents` returns empty records, ensure you've:
   - Successfully completed the OAuth flow
   - Updated the connection metadata with file/folder IDs
   - Triggered the sync after updating metadata

2. **Access Token**:
   - Always get the access token from Nango's connection endpoint
   - Use the token to initialize the Google Picker
   - Handle token refresh automatically through Nango

3. **Action Timeouts**: If `fetch-document` actions timeout:
   - Verify you're using the correct provider for the file type
   - Check the file permissions in Google Drive
   - Ensure the file size **does not exceed 10MB**

4. **Downloading Content**: When downloading content from Google Drive, we recommend using the [Nango proxy for downloading content](https://docs.nango.dev/guides/proxy-requests#proxy-requests) especially for large files.
