    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Workday_.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Workday">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Workday. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Workday SOAP API">
        Let's make your first request to the Workday SOAP API (fetch workers using Human_Resources service). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK and SOAP library with `npm i @nangohq/node soap`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';
            import soap from 'soap';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });
            const connectionId = '<CONNECTION-ID>';
            const providerConfigKey = '<INTEGRATION-ID>';
            
            const connection = await nango.getConnection(providerConfigKey, connectionId);
            const { credentials, connection_config } = connection;

            if (
              credentials.type !== "BASIC" ||
              !credentials.username ||
              !credentials.password ||
              !connection_config["hostname"] ||
              !connection_config["tenant"]
            ) {
              throw new Error(
                "Invalid credentials: BASIC auth, username, password, hostname, and tenant are all required."
              );
            }

            // Example: Get workers using Human_Resources service
            const serviceType = 'Human_Resources';
            const version = '40.0';
            const wsdlUrl = `https://community.workday.com/sites/default/files/file-hosting/productionapi/${serviceType}/v${version}/${serviceType}.wsdl`;
            const endpointUrl = `https://${connection_config["hostname"]}/ccx/service/${connection_config["tenant"]}/${serviceType}/v${version}`;
            

            const client = await soap.createClientAsync(wsdlUrl, {});
            client.addHttpHeader("Accept-Encoding", "gzip, deflate"); // Needed or some queries will fail https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/4806

            client.setSecurity(
              new soap.WSSecurity(credentials.username, credentials.password),
            );
            client.setEndpoint(endpointUrl);

            // Make SOAP request to Get_WorkersAsync
            const [res] = await client["Get_WorkersAsync"]({
              Response_Filter: {
                Page: 1,
                Count: 100,
              },
            });

            console.log('Workers Response:', JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

    Next step: [Embed the auth flow](/getting-started/quickstart/embed-in-your-app) in your app to let your users connect their Workday accounts.

  <Tab title="ðŸš¨ API gotchas">
    - Workday provides two APIs, a REST and a SOAP one. Nango supports them both.
    - Workday requires a user-specific `hostname` and `tenant` for the API base URL.
    - Access to most Workday's API documentation is typically restricted to Workday customers and partners.
