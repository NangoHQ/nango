## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Obtain a Workday tenant">
    To use the Workday API, you need access to a Workday tenant. Contact your Workday administrator or [Workday sales](https://www.workday.com/en-us/company/contact-sales.html) to obtain access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create API credentials">
    1. Log in to your Workday tenant as an administrator.
    2. Navigate to the **Integrations** section.
    3. Select **API Credentials** or **Integration System User**.
    4. Click **Create Integration System User**.
    5. Provide a name for your integration user.
    6. Assign the appropriate security groups and permissions based on the API endpoints you need to access.
    7. Save the integration user.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate username and password">
    1. After creating the integration system user, navigate to the user's details.
    2. Generate or set a username and password for the integration user.
    3. Make sure to securely store these credentials as they will be used for API authentication.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Determine your Workday tenant URL">
    1. Your Workday tenant URL follows this format: `https://{tenant-name}.workday.com`
    2. The `{tenant-name}` portion is your specific Workday subdomain.
    3. Note this subdomain as it will be required for API requests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure API access permissions">
    1. In Workday, navigate to **Security Administration**.
    2. Select **Domain Security Policies**.
    3. Configure the appropriate security policies to allow API access for your integration user.
    4. Ensure the integration user has the necessary permissions for the specific Web Services you plan to use.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test API access">
    Before integrating with Nango, you can test your API credentials using a tool like Postman:
    
    1. Create a new request in Postman.
    2. Set the request URL to a Workday API endpoint (e.g., `https://{tenant-name}.workday.com/ccx/service/{tenant-name}/Human_Resources/v40.0`).
    3. Set the authentication type to Basic Auth.
    4. Enter your integration username and password.
    5. Send the request to verify your credentials work correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connection configuration in Nango

Workday requires a user specific subdomain for the API base URL.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('workday', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {subdomain: '<workday-subdomain>'}});
```

For more details see the [docs here](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

- Workday provides two APIs, a REST and a SOAP one. Only the SOAP API is currently supported in Nango.
- The Workday API requires a tenant-specific subdomain in the API URL. Make sure to collect this from your users.
- Workday API credentials are tied to specific security groups and permissions. Ensure your integration user has all necessary permissions for the endpoints you need to access.
- Workday API responses can be quite verbose with extensive XML structures. Be prepared to parse complex responses.
- API rate limits may vary based on your Workday contract and tenant configuration.
- Workday API versions are updated regularly with major releases. Be aware of version compatibility when making API calls.
- For security reasons, Workday may require IP whitelisting for API access. Contact your Workday administrator to ensure Nango's IP addresses are whitelisted if needed.
- Session timeouts can occur with long-running processes. Implement proper error handling for authentication failures.
- The Workday API follows a different structure than most REST APIs. Familiarize yourself with their specific request and response formats.
