## Useful links

Workday provides two APIs, a REST and a SOAP one. Only the SOAP is currently supported.

## Connection configuration in Nango

Workday requires a user specific hostname and tenant for the API base URL.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('workday', '<CONNECTION-ID>', { params: { hostname: '<workday-hostname>', tenant: '<workday-tenant>' }});
```

For more details see the [docs here](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).
