## API gotchas

- JumpCloud uses both v1 and v2 APIs. Depending on your integration needs, you may need to use both versions.
- The API key must be included in the `x-api-key` header for all requests.
- Rate limiting applies - refer to the API documentation for current limits.
- Some endpoints require specific permissions for the admin user associated with the API key.
