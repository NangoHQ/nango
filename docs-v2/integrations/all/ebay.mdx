## API gotchas

-   App ID is Client ID and Cert ID is Client Secret
-   For sandbox, use `ebay-sandbox` integration, for production use `ebay` integration
-   Add a Redirect URL and set "Your auth accepted URL" to your Nango callback URL:
        - Default: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
        - Self-hosted: Your custom redirect URL
