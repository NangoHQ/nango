## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Atlassian developer account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for an [Atlassian developer account](https://id.atlassian.com/signup/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app">
    1. Go to the [Atlassian Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/).
    2. Click **Create** and select **OAuth 2.0 integration**.
    3. Enter a name, agree to Atlassian's developer terms by checking the agreement checkbox for your app and click **Create**.
    4. Your app will be created and you'll be taken to the app management page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OAuth 2.0 (3LO)">
    1. In the left sidebar, select **Authorization**.
    2. Next to OAuth 2.0 (3LO), click **Add**.
    3. Enter `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` as the Callback URL.
    4. Click **Save** to save your changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add API permissions">
    1. In the left sidebar, select **Permissions**.
    2. Find the Confluence API and click **Add**, and then click **Configure**.
    3. Click **Edit Scopes** then select the scopes your application requires. Common scopes include:
       - `read:confluence-user` - Read user information
       - `read:confluence-content.all` - Read all content
       - `read:confluence-content.summary` - Read content summaries
       - `write:confluence-content` - Create and update content
       - `delete:confluence-content` - Delete content
       - `manage:confluence-configuration` - Manage Confluence instance settings
       - `offline_access` - Get refresh tokens (required for long-term access)
    4. Click **Save** to save your changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain your client credentials">
    1. In the left sidebar, select **Settings**.
    2. Note your **Client ID**.
    3. Copy both the Client ID and Secret by clicking the copy buttons next to them, as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your app available to users (optional)">
    If you want to distribute your app to other users:
    
    1. In the left sidebar, select **Distribution**.
    2. In **Distribution controls**, click the **Edit** button, then select the **Sharing** radio button.
    3. Return to the Authorization page and copy the Authorization URL to share with your users.
    
    Note: By default, your app is private and can only be used by you. Making it public allows other users to authorize your app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Scopes

| Scope | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| read:confluence-user | Read user information |
| read:confluence-content.all | Read all Confluence content |
| write:confluence-content | Create and update Confluence content |
| offline_access | Access to refresh tokens for offline access |



## API gotchas

-   To allow the possibility of refreshing the token, you must add `offline_access` to your scopes when creating the integration on the Nango UI.
-   You will need to fetch your Cloud ID to be able to make API requests to the Confluence API. You can do this with the proxy by calling:

```ts
const response = await nango.get({
    endpoint: `oauth/token/accessible-resources`,
    baseUrlOverride: 'https://api.atlassian.com'
});
const cloudId = response.data[0].id;
```

You can then construct your URL as follows: `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/confluence/${cloudId}/rest/api/<endpoint>`

-   When you create an OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app, it's private by default. Before using the integration, you must make your app public. If you want to make your app public, find the how-to [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/#distributing-your-oauth-2-0--3lo--apps).
-   Refresh tokens will expire after 365 days of non use and will expire by 90 days if the resource owner is inactive for 90 days. Make sure you call `nango.getConnection()` at least every 365 days to trigger a refresh. See reference [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/#how-do-i-get-a-new-access-token--if-my-access-token-expires-or-is-revoked-).
-   The `state` parameter is required for security in the OAuth flow to prevent CSRF attacks. Nango handles this automatically.
-   Confluence's OAuth implementation uses rotating refresh tokens. Each time you refresh an access token, you'll receive a new refresh token that invalidates the previous one.
-   When making API calls, remember that the permissions of the user who authorized your app will limit what your app can do, regardless of the scopes you've requested.
-   Confluence and Jira share the same OAuth infrastructure, so the OAuth setup process is identical for both products.
-   The Confluence REST API has different versions. Make sure you're using the correct version for your needs.
