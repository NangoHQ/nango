## API gotchas
-   To implement OAuth for your application, you must be issued API credentials first. Please reach out to PreciseFP support at support@precisefp.com to get your API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret).
-   Once you have your API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret), you are ready to start implementing the OAuth Authorization.
-   The scope of access should always be "*" as required by PreciseFP's API. This is the only scope value accepted by their authorization server. PreciseFP manages access control on their server side based on the user's permissions.
-   The API has a rate limit of 60 requests per minute. Exceeding this limit will result in HTTP 429 responses.
-   The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success and error responses.
