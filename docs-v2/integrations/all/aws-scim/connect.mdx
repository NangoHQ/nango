# Overview

To authenticate with AWS SCIM, you need two key pieces of information:
1. **SCIM API Token** - A token generated from your AWS IAM Identity Center to authenticate SCIM requests.
2. **SCIM Endpoint** - The base domain for SCIM API requests.

This guide will walk you through the steps to generate and use this token to connect your AWS account.

---

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an AWS account.
- SCIM is supported only for IAM Identity Center users and not for IAM users.
- The logged-in user must have the necessary admin privileges to generate the SCIM API token in IAM Identity Provider.
