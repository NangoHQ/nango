## Important limitations

- **Limited functionality**: Private API (Bearer Auth) is limited to just storing API keys. Because it's generic, it does not have a base URL and many advanced Nango features are not available for it.
- **Base URL required**: Since Private API (Basic Auth) is generic, depending on how you intend to use it (within integrations or making direct proxy calls), you must override the base URL. You cannot rely on a predefined base URL like other integrations.
- **Recommended use cases only**: The only recommended use case for private API integrations is to store credentials for internal/customer-specific APIs that cannot be added to the Nango catalog.
- **For all other use cases**: We recommend [contributing the API to Nango](/guides/custom-integrations/build-a-custom-integration) or requesting it be added by us.
