## API gotchas

- If you would like to set up a sandbox API environment, one can sign up [here](https://www-test.bill.com/signup?env=stage). Once you have successfully created an account, please [email](mailto:developerprogram@hq.bill.com) the team and they will send you the API credentials.
- When creating a new connection in Nango, please provide the following: Username (the email address used to sign in to your BILL developer account), Password (used to sign in to your BILL developer account), Organization ID (a unique alphanumeric value beginning with 008 that represents your organization), and Developer key (provided by the team and used to identify your developer account in API requests).
- After creating a connection, you can use the credentials as follows;
```js
const connection = await nango.getConnection();
// Initialize credentials object
let credentials: { session_id?: string; dev_key?: string } = {};

// Check for session ID and developer key
if ('session_id' in connection.credentials && 'dev_key' in connection.credentials) {
    credentials = {
        session_id: connection.credentials.session_id,
        dev_key: connection.credentials.dev_key,
        };
    } else {
        throw new nango.ActionError({
            message: `Session ID and Developer Key are incomplete or missing`
        });
    }

    // Define the configuration for the API call
    const config: ProxyConfiguration = {
        endpoint: 'users',
        retries: 10,
        paginate: {
            type: 'cursor',
            cursor_name_in_request: 'page',
            cursor_path_in_response: 'nextPage',
            response_path: 'results',
            limit_name_in_request: 'max',
            limit: 100
        },
        headers: {
            sessionId: credentials.session_id,
            devKey: credentials.dev_key
        },
    };
```
