## API gotchas
- GitHub provides two types of tokens for authentication:
1. **Classic Personal Access Tokens (PATs)** – These are the older, broad-scope tokens that grant access to a user's repositories, organizations, and settings.
2. **Fine-Grained Personal Access Tokens** – Introduced as a more secure alternative, these tokens allow for precise permission control at the repository and organization level.
- GitHub recommends using **Fine-grained PATs** whenever possible, as they provide better security and least-privilege access by allowing developers to specify the exact permissions and repositories they apply to. Classic PATs still work but are considered less secure due to their broad permissions
