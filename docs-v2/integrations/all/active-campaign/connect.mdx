# Overview

To authenticate with ActiveCampaign, you need:
1. **Hostname** - The Hostname to your ActiveCampaign instance.
2. **API Key** - A key that grants Nango permission to interact with ActiveCampaign's APIs resources and services.

This guide will walk you through obtaining both **Hostname** and **API Key** within ActiveCampaign.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an account with ActiveCampaign.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding Your Hostname
1. Log in to your [ActiveCampaign](https://www.activecampaign.com/login) account.
2. Navigate to the **Settings** page, then go to the **Developer** tab.
3. Your **Hostname** is the part of the URL that appears after `https://`.  In this example, it would be `nango.activehosted.com`.
