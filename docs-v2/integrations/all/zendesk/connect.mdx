- If you didn't enable the [host-mapping feature](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408838571930-Host-mapping-Changing-the-URL-of-your-help-center) in Zendesk, your subdomain can be found in your account URL, between `https://` and `.zendesk.com`.

#### Step 2: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have the **Subdomain**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Zendesk.
