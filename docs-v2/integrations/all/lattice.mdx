## API gotchas

- Lattice API endpoints and fields are subject to change at any time without notice.
- The API has a rate limit of 240 requests per minute.
- All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. 
- The Lattice API was designed to only be called from a server and thus does not provide any CORS ability. This is to protect you and your user's data. By calling this API from a browser would expose your bearer tokens and allow a malicious actor to access data they should not be exposed to.
