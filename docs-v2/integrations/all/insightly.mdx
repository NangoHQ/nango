## API gotchas

- Insightly uses `Basic` auth mode to access different endpoints. Provide your `api key` as your username and leave the password field empty.
- Your instances `pod` can be determined by accessing `User Settings` and finding the API URL right under your API Key in the API Section. This connection config will be set when creating a new connection on Nango i.e: If this is your API URL ; `https://api.na1.insightly.com/v3.1/` add `na1` as your pod connection config.
- Insightly still supports older API versions, but they have fewer endpoints. To use a specific version of the API append it to your `base_url` as follows: `/v3.1/Contacts` or `/v3.0/Contacts`.
- Depending on the pricing plan, there are various rate limits. Once your limit is reached, you will no longer be able to make requests against that endpoint until next day.
- You can have a look at the following [Nango](https://docs.nango.dev/customize/guides/advanced/handle-rate-limits) resource to see how best you can handle rate limits.
