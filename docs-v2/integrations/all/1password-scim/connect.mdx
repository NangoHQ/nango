# Overview

To connect your **1Password SCIM** account, you need to authenticate using an **API Key** and a **SCIM Bridge URL**. This allows Nango to securely manage user provisioning, deprovisioning, and access control through the 1Password SCIM API.

This guide will help you retrieve your SCIM credentials and set up the connection.

---

### Prerequisites

- A **1Password Business or Enterprise** account.
- A **SCIM Bridge** deployed and running on infrastructure that you control.
- A **SCIM API Key** generated from your **1Password Admin Console**.
- The **SCIM Bridge URL** (e.g., `https://scim.example.com`).

ðŸš¨ **Important**:  
1Password requires **SCIM Bridge** to be hosted on your infrastructure for security reasons. This ensures that **encryption keys** are never exposed to third parties.

### Step 1: Retrieve Your 1Password SCIM API Key

1. Log in to your [1Password Admin Console](https://my.1password.com).
2. Navigate to **Integrations** and select **SCIM**.
3. Click **View SCIM Bridge** to access your SCIM configuration.
4. Generate a new **SCIM API Key** for authentication.

### Step 2: Get Your SCIM Bridge URL

Your SCIM Bridge URL is required for the integration. It typically follows this format:

https://scim.yourdomain.com


If you're unsure of your SCIM Bridge URL:
- Check with your **IT team** or **1Password administrator**.
- Look in the **1Password SCIM configuration** settings.

#### **SCIM Bridge Behavior Based on Identity Provider**
ðŸš¨ **Important Note on Google Workspace, Entra, and Okta**:

- If your **SCIM Bridge is configured for Google Workspace**, the **SCIM API is disabled**. Instead, 1Password pulls data directly using **Google APIs** rather than SCIM.  
  ðŸ”´ **This means that the SCIM integration will not work if Google Workspace is your IdP**.

- If your **SCIM Bridge is configured for Entra (Azure AD) or Okta**, then **SCIM is enabled**. In this case:
  - The **IdP (Identity Provider)** will connect to **SCIM Bridge** to provision and deprovision users.
  - The **SCIM interface remains active**.

âœ… **How to check if SCIM is enabled?**  
1. Go to **SCIM Bridge Settings** in your 1Password Admin Console.
2. If your IdP is **Google Workspace**, SCIM is **disabled**.
3. If your IdP is **Entra or Okta**, SCIM is **enabled** and can be used for provisioning.

1. Open the **1Password SCIM integration setup** in Nango.
2. Enter your **SCIM Bridge URL** and **API Key**.
3. Click **Connect** to validate the credentials and establish the connection.
