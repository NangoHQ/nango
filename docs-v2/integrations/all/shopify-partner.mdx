## Setup guide

### Step 1: Get Your Partner ID
1. Log in to your [Shopify Partner account](https://partners.shopify.com)
2. Your Partner ID is the number in the URL when you're on your partner home page: `https://partners.shopify.com/1234567`
   - For example, if your URL is `https://partners.shopify.com/1234567`, your Partner ID is `1234567`

### Step 2: Create a Partner API Client
1. Go to your Partner API Clients page: `https://partners.shopify.com/{your-partner-id}/settings/partner_api_clients`
2. Click "Create API client"
3. Give your API client a name (e.g., "Nango Integration")
4. Select the necessary permissions for your integration
5. Click "Create API client"
6. Copy the generated API client access token - you'll need this for the next step

### Step 3: Create the Integration in Nango
1. Go to the Nango dashboard
2. Navigate to the Integrations tab
3. Click "Add Integration"
4. Select "Shopify Partner" from the list
5. Enter your:
   - Partner ID (from Step 1)
   - Partner API Client Access Token (from Step 2)

### Step 4: Create a Connection
1. Go to the Connections tab
2. Click "Add Connection"
3. Select your Shopify Partner integration
4. Complete the connection setup

## Connection configuration in Nango

Shopify Partner requires two pieces of information for authentication:
1. Partner ID
2. Partner API Client Access Token

You can pass these to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('shopify-partner', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {
    params: {
        partnerId: '<your-partner-id>',
        apiKey: '<your-partner-api-token>'
    }
});
```

## API gotchas

1. The Partner ID must be included in the API URL path
2. All requests require the X-Shopify-Access-Token header
3. The API version in the URL must match the version you're targeting (e.g. 2025-04)
