## API gotchas
- Affinity gives you only an `API Key` but uses Basic auth for the API. Pass the `API Key` as the password to Nango and leave the username blank.
- The Affinity API is only for Premium and Enterprise tier customers, and for Professional tier customers _who signed up for Affinity before July 5, 2023_.
- Currently, Affinity supports _one key per user_ on your team.
- There is a limit of _three webhook subscriptions per Affinity instance_.
- For rate limit details, check out [Affinity](https://api-docs.affinity.co/#rate-limits).
