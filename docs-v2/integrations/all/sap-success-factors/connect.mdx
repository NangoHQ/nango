# Overview

To authenticate with SAP SuccessFactors, you need:
1. **API Server** - The base URL of your SAP SuccessFactors OData API instance.
2. **Company ID** - Your company's unique identifier in SAP SuccessFactors.
3. **API Key** - The API Key generated during the OAuth client application registration process in SAP SuccessFactors. 
4. **SAML Assertion** -A Base64-encoded XML document that contains security statements about a subject (typically a user). It is digitally signed using the private key associated with an X.509 certificate to ensure authenticity and integrity.

This guide will walk you through obtaining these credentials within SAP SuccessFactors.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an account with SAP SuccessFactors.

### Instructions:
#### Step 1: Finding your API Server
1. Please visit the following [API Server URLs](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SUCCESSFACTORS_PLATFORM/93f95815070049ebaaff042d8322d518/af2b8d5437494b12be88fe374eba75b6.html)
2. In the listed API Server URLs, search for the environment that matches your subdomain.
- For example, if your domain was https://**salesdemo4**.successfactors.com, search for **salesdemo4**.

#### Step 2: Finding your Company ID
1. Login to your **SAP SuccessFactors** account. Go to the upper right hand side and click on your profile image to view your username.

2. To find your SAP SuccessFactors **Company ID**, in the same dropdown menu, click **Show version information**. Locate **Company ID** in the modal that pops up:

#### Step 3: Generating your API Key
1. In your **Admin Center**, go to Tools, and search **Manage OAuth2 Client Applications** (If your page looks different, search for **Manage OAuth2 Client Applications** in the search tool on your homepage).

2. Click **Register Client Application**.
<img src="/integrations/all/sap-success-factors/register.png" />
3. Fill out **Application Name** & **Application URL** (what actually goes in these fields is not important, except that the URL has to begin with **https://**). You can also have a look at this [guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SUCCESSFACTORS_PLATFORM/d599f15995d348a1b45ba5603e2aba9b/6b3c741483de47b290d075d798163bc1.html#procedure) on how to fill this form.
4. Run the following command to generate a 2048-bit RSA private key and a Certificate Signing Request (CSR):
```
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout private.pem -out request.csr
```
- You will be prompted to enter information such as country, organization, and Common Name (CN).   
6. Use the private key to create a self-signed public certificate valid for 10 years:
```
openssl req -new -x509 -key private.pem -out cert.pem -days 3650
```
7. Open the `cert.pem` file in a text editor, copy its entire contents (excluding the -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END CERTIFICATE----- lines), and paste it into the **X.509 Certificate** field in the SuccessFactors form.

8. Finally, click **Register** to complete your registration.
9. You’ve successfully registered your client application for OAuth2 authentication. An **API key** is generated and assigned to your application. You can view the **API key** by clicking **View** on the registered application list.

#### Step 4: Generating your SAML Assertion
- You can use a corporate IdP, for example, **SAP Identity Authentication Services**, or a third-party IdP.
- You can also use the example code attached to [3031657](https://sap.github.io/SapMachine/#download) to generate **SAML Assertion** for your application. 
- You can also opt for this simple script prepared by us to generate your **SAML Assertion** locally. 

1. Now that your certificate is registered with SuccessFactors, you can generate a **SAML Assertion** using the private key and the certificate you just created from [step 3](#step-3%3A-generating-your-api-key) above. From the same folder where your `private.pem` and `cert.pem` files were generated and registered, you can now use the following script to generate the SAML assertion.
- To generate your SAML assertion, you’ll need to provide the following values:
- **API Key** – This is your API Key obtained during application registration.
- **Hostname**– Your SuccessFactors API server (e.g., hcm68sales.successfactors.com).
- **Company ID** – The company identifier used in your SuccessFactors environment (e.g., SFCPART001523).
- **Username or User ID** – Depending on your integration setup, provide either your SuccessFactors username or user ID.

```js
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { dirname } from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import { Saml20 } from 'saml';
import crypto from 'crypto';
import readlineSync from 'readline-sync';

const __dirname = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));

const getUserInput = () => {
  const clientId = readlineSync.question('Enter your SuccessFactors API Key: ');
  const hostname = readlineSync.question('Enter your SuccessFactors hostname (e.g., hcm68sales.successfactors.com): ');
  const companyId = readlineSync.question('Enter your company ID (e.g., SFCPART001523): ');
  
  const username = readlineSync.question('Enter your SuccessFactors username (leave blank to use userId): ');
  let userId = '';
  if (!username) {
    userId = readlineSync.question('Enter your SuccessFactors userId: ');
  }

  return {
    clientId,
    hostname,
    companyId,
    username,
    userId
  };
};

const readCertificateFiles = () => {
  try {
    return {
      cert: readFileSync(`cert.pem`, 'utf8'),
      privateKey: readFileSync(`private.pem`, 'utf8')
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error reading certificate files:', error.message);
    console.log('Please ensure both public.pem and private.pem exist');
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

const createSamlOptions = (config, certData) => {
  const isUsingUsername = !!config.username;

  return {
    cert: certData.cert,
    key: certData.privateKey,
    issuer: 'www.successfactors.com',
    lifetimeInSeconds: 315360000,
    audiences: 'www.successfactors.com',
    attributes: {
      api_key: config.clientId,
      use_username: isUsingUsername ? 'true' : 'false',
      use_email: 'false',
      external_user: 'true',
      ...(isUsingUsername ? {} : { user_id: config.userId })
    },
    nameIdentifier: isUsingUsername
      ? `${config.username}#DIV#${config.companyId}`
      : config.userId,
    sessionIndex: crypto.randomUUID(),
    recipient: `https://${config.hostname}/oauth/token`
  };
};

const generateSamlAssertion = () => {
  const config = getUserInput();
  const certData = readCertificateFiles();
  const options = createSamlOptions(config, certData);

  const rawAssertion = Saml20.create(options);
  const assertion = Buffer.from(rawAssertion).toString('base64');

  console.log('\n✅ SAML client assertion');
  console.log(assertion);
};

generateSamlAssertion();
```
- Run the script from the same folder where your certificate files are located, and provide the required details as described above. A SAML Assertion will then be generated.

#### Step 5: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have both the above keys:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with SAP SuccessFactors.
2. Enter the **API Server**, **Company ID**, **API Key** and **SAML Assertion** in their designated fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
