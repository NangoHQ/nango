# Overview

To authenticate with Auth0 (Client Credentials), you need one key piece of information:
1. **Client ID** - A unique identifier for your client.
2. **Client Secret** - A confidential key used to authenticate the identity of the application (client).
3. **HostName** - The domain associated with your Auth0 tenant.
4. **Audience** - The audience for the token, which is your API.
5. **Organization** - The organization name or identifier you want the request to be associated with.

This guide will walk you through finding or generating these credentials within Auth0.

#### Step 2: Finding Your HostName
- From the **Quickstart** tab of your newly created application, Auth0 provides an example request for obtaining an access token. Your **HostName** is the text that appears after `https://` and before `/oauth/token`.
- In the example below, the HostName is `dev-tb1x5mahjyey84y4.us.auth0.com`.

- You can find this in the **Identifier** field of your newly created application under the **APIs** tab.

- <Tip>This is optional and can be obtained from the **Organizations** page of your newly created application if your tenant is configured to use **Organizations**.</Tip>

#### Step 5: Enter credentials in the Connect UI
