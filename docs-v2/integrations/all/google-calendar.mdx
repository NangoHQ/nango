## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Google Cloud account">

    2. Click on the project dropdown at the top left of the page.
    3. Click **New Project**.
    4. Enter a **Project Name** for your project 
    5. Under **Location**, select the appropriate organization or folder where this project should belong.
    <Note>If you're not part of an organization, it will default to No organization</Note>
    6. Click **Create** and wait for the project to be created.
    5. Select it from the project dropdown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable the APIs you need">
    1. Go to the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) in the Google Cloud Console.
    2. Search for **Google Calendar API** and select the ones you wish to integrate with, such as **Google Calendar API**, **CalDAV API**, etc., then click **Enable** for each.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the OAuth consent screen">
    1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen** in the Google Cloud Console.
    2. Click **Get started**.
    3. Fill in the **App Information** form.
      - **App Name**: The name of the app asking for consent.
      - **User support email**: For users to contact you with questions about their consent
    4. Click **Next**. Select the appropriate Audience:
       - **External**: For applications available to any Google user
       - **Internal**: For applications restricted to users within your Google Workspace organization
    5. Click **Next**. Fill in the **Contact Information**, these are the email addresses that Google will use to notify you about any changes to your project.
    6. Click **Next**, then check the **I agree to the Google API Services: User Data Policy** checkbox, and click **Continue**.
    7. Add the scopes your application needs. Under **Data Access**, click **Add or Remove Scopes** and select the scopes that correspond to the APIs you enabled.
    8  Under **Audience**, click **Add users** if you selected **External** user type (required for testing before verification).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create OAuth 2.0 credentials">
    1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** in the Google Cloud Console.
    2. Click **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
    3. Select **Web application** as the application type.
    4. Enter a name for your OAuth client.
    5. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
    6. Click **Create**.
    7. A dialog will appear with your client ID and client secret. Save these credentials securely as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
    <Step title="Publish your app (switch from Testing to Production)">
    To move your OAuth app from testing to production:
    1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen** > **Audience**.
    2. Click **Publish App** to switch your app from testing to production.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify your app (if required)">
    If your app uses sensitive or restricted scopes, you’ll need to verify it with Google:
    1. Once published to production, click **Prepare for Verification** to start the verification process.
    2. Review and confirm all app details, then click **Save and Continue**.
    3. Justify your use of any sensitive or restricted scopes.
    4. Upload a demo video showing your app's OAuth flow and scope usage.
    5. Click **Submit for Verification** to begin Google’s review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).

## API gotchas
-   From the scopes page, make sure to select scopes based on the APIs you enabled earlier when setting up the app.
-   Under certain circumstances, Google expires a user's refresh token and the token refresh in Nango will fail. You can find a [list of reasons from Google here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#expiration), including:
1.   The user has [revoked your app's access](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3466521#remove-access).
2.  The user changed passwords and the refresh token contains Gmail scopes.
3.  The user account has exceeded a maximum number of granted (live) refresh tokens.
4.  The user granted [time-based access](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#time-based-access) to your app and the access expired.
5.  If an admin [set any of the services requested in your app's scopes to Restricted](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227#restrictaccess).
6.  For [Google Cloud Platform APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#gcp) - the session length set by the admin could have been exceeded.
7.  In "Testing" mode with an external user type, refresh tokens expire in 7 days unless only basic scopes are used — userinfo.email, userinfo.profile, openid, or their [OpenID Connect equivalents](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#openid-connect). You can remove this 7-day limit by switch from Testing to Production. Follow step 6 in the [Setup Guide](#setup-guide) above.
8.  Google allows up to 100 refresh tokens per account per OAuth client ID; new tokens overwrite the oldest without warning when the limit is reached.
-   While setting up the OAuth credentials, the _Authorized JavaScript origins_ should be your site URL (`https://app.nango.dev` if you're testing from the Nango UI).
-   For applications using sensitive or restricted scopes, Google requires verification and a security assessment. This process can take several weeks to complete.
-   Google's OAuth consent screen has different configurations for "External" and "Internal" user types. Internal is only available for Google Workspace users and limits access to users within your organization.
-   Google implements incremental authorization, allowing you to request additional scopes over time without requiring users to re-authorize all previously granted scopes.
-   Google enforces [rate limits](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reports/v1/limits) on API requests, which vary depending on the specific API being used.
