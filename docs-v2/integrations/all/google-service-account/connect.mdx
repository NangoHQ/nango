# Overview

To authenticate with Google Service Account, you need:  
1. **Service Account Email Address** – The unique email assigned to your service account.  
2. **Private Key** – The private key generated when creating a service account key.  
3. **Scopes** – A list of Google APIs scopes space separated your application should have access to.  
4. **Delegated Access Email Address (optional)** – The user’s email if you need domain-wide delegation in Google Workspace.

This guide will walk you through creating and obtaining your **Service Account credentials** in Google Cloud.

### Prerequisites

- If you don’t already have one, sign up for a [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/).  

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Create a Service Account
1. Go to the [Service Accounts page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts).  
2. Select an existing project, or create a new one.  
3. Click **+ Create Service Account**.  
4. Fill in all the required information, then click **Create and continue**.  
5. (Optional) Assign **Permissions** and **Principals with access**.  
6. Click **Done**.

#### Step 2: Generate a Service Account Key
1. From the Service accounts page, click the **email address** of the service account you created.  
2. Navigate to the **Keys** tab.  
3. Click **Add key** → **Create new key**.  
4. Select **JSON** format and click **Create**.  
5. A `.json` key file will be downloaded to your machine. Store it securely — this contains your **Private Key**.  

⚠️ Google does not keep a copy of the private key. If you lose it, you’ll need to generate a new one.

#### Step 3: Delegate Domain-Wide Authority (optional, for Google Workspace)
If your application needs to act on behalf of users in your domain (e.g. read all users’ calendars), you must enable domain-wide delegation:  

1. From your Google Workspace Admin console, go to **Security > Access and data control > API Controls**.  
2. Under **Domain-wide delegation**, click **Manage Domain Wide Delegation**.  
3. Click **Add new**.  
4. Enter the **Client ID** of your service account (from the Service Accounts page).  
5. In **OAuth scopes**, enter the list of scopes you want to grant, for example:  

#### Step 4: Enter credentials in the Connect UI
Once you’ve all the required credentials:  
 
1. Open the form to authenticate with Google Service Account.  
2. Enter your credentials in their respective fields.  
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
