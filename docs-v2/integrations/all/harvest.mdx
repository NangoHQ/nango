## API gotchas
- When creating a connection, you need to add the `appDetails` configuration parameter in the format `MyApp (yourname@example.com)`, which will be appended to the request as a header: `User-Agent: MyApp (yourname@example.com)`. This information will be used to get in touch if you’re doing something wrong(so the provider can warn you before you’re blocked) or something awesome (so the provider can congratulate you). Requests without a valid `User-Agent` header are rejected.
- Harvest enforces different rate limits for different endpoints. For more details check [harvest rate limits](https://help.getharvest.com/api-v2/introduction/overview/general/#rate-limiting)
