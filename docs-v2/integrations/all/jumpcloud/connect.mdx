# Overview

To authenticate with JumpCloud, you need:
1. **API Key** - A key that grants Nango permission to interact with JumpCloud's API resources and services.

This guide will walk you through obtaining these credentials within JumpCloud.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a valid JumpCloud Administrator account
- Your account must have appropriate permissions to generate API keys

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Generate Your JumpCloud API Key

1. Log in to the [JumpCloud Admin Portal](https://console.jumpcloud.com/)
2. In the top-right corner, click on your account initials
3. Select **My API Key** from the dropdown menu
4. Click **Generate New API Key** to create a new API key

**Important Security Notes:**
- Generating a new API key will revoke access to the current API key
- This will render all existing integrations using the previous API key inaccessible
- Only administrators with appropriate roles can access the API
- Keep your API key secure and do not share it, as it grants full access to your JumpCloud instance

#### Step 2: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **API Key**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with JumpCloud
2. Enter your **API Key** in the respective field
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated

You are now connected to JumpCloud and can access both v1 and v2 API endpoints.
