## API gotchas

- Buildium uses API_KEY auth mode with `x-buildium-client-id: ClientSecret`and `x-buildium-client-secret: ApiKey` in the request header to access different endpoints.
- Buildium enforces a general rate limit of 10 concurrent requests per second. For more details check [Buildium API rate limits](https://developer.buildium.com/#section/API-Overview/Rate-Limiting)
