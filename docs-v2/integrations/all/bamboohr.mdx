## Connection configuration in Nango

BambooHR requires a user specific subdomain to authenticate

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
// API key
nango.auth('bamboohr-basic', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {
        credentials: {
            username: '<END-USER-API-KEY>',
            password: 'x'
        },
        params: {
            subdomain: '<bamboohr-subdomain>'
        }
    })
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

- When creating a connection, you need to add the subdomain as a params argument, for example: `nango.auth('bamhoo-hr', '1', {params: {subdomain: '<your-subdomain>'}})`.
- Authenticating via API key: BambooHR gives only an `API Key` but uses Basic auth for the API. Pass the `API Key` as the username and use `x` for the password. See BambooHR [documentation](https://documentation.bamboohr.com/docs#section-authentication)
