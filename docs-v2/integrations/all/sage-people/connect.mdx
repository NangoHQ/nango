# Overview

To authenticate with Sage People, you need:
1. **API User** - A user with the correct permission sets for the endpoints you want to access
2. **Access Token** - A bearer token obtained through Salesforce OAuth authentication

This guide will walk you through setting up API access and obtaining an access token within Sage People.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a Sage People account with Admin rights
- You need to create a Connected App in Salesforce for OAuth authentication

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Create an API User with Correct Permissions

For detailed instructions on creating an API user, see the [Sage People API documentation](https://developer.sage.com/people/get-started/#create-a-sage-people-api-user).

1. Log into your Sage People account
2. Go to **Setup** > **Administration Setup** > **Manage Users** > **Users**
3. Create a new user or select an existing user
4. Assign the appropriate permission sets based on the endpoints you need to access

Note: Make sure to set appropriate object-level permissions. The 'read' permission allows viewing records created by the user and shared with them, while 'view all' permission grants access to all records across the organization.

#### Step 2: Set Up OAuth Authentication

For detailed instructions on OAuth setup, see the [Sage People OAuth documentation](https://developer.sage.com/people/get-started/#obtain-an-access-token).

1. Create a Connected App in Salesforce for OAuth authentication
2. Configure the Connected App with the following OAuth scope:
   - Access and manage your data (api)
3. Follow the Salesforce OAuth flow to obtain an access token

2. Enter your **Access Token** obtained through the OAuth flow
3. Submit the form to complete authentication
