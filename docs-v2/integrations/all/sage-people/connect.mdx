   - Leave the other fields default as they are.
4. Click **Save**

### Set Required Permissions

After creating the user, we will now edit the Permission Set Assignments and set the required [permissions](https://developer.sage.com/people/get-started/#api-permission-set-mapping) based on the API endpoints you plan to use:

| API Endpoint | Permission Set Name |
|--------------|-------------------|
| `/employees` | Sage People Employees API |
| `/employees/{employeeID}/payDetails` | Sage People Pay Details API |
| `/salaries` | Sage People Salaries API |
| `/bonuses` | Sage People Bonuses API |
| `/absences` | Sage People Absences API |
| `/absenceBalances` | Sage People Absence Balances API |
| `/timesheets` | Sage People Timesheets API |

### Assign Permission Sets

4. Click **Edit Assignments**
5. Select the appropriate permission sets based on the API endpoints you need
6. Click **Save**

### Important Note on Permissions

In the Object Settings of a permission set, note the difference between:
- **`Read` permission**: User can view records they created and records shared with them
- **`View All` permission**: Ignores sharing rules and allows access to records across the organization
