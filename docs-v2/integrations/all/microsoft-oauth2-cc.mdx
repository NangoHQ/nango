## API gotchas
-   Microsoft has a unified OAuth system for their various APIs. This provider should work for most of them (e.g. Microsoft EntraID, OneNote, Onedrive, Outlook, Sharepoint Online, Microsoft Teams etc.).
-   You can find permissions required for each API call in their corresponding API methods section, i.e, to retrieve a list of notebook objects from Onenote, you can have a look at [List Notebooks permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/onenote-list-notebooks?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http#permissions).
-   See particularly the `tenantId` parameter under [Get a token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow#get-a-token).
-   This `tenantId` parameter must be provided as [extra configuration to the frontend SDK](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).
-   Microsoft offers a tool that allows you to construct and perform Graph API queries and see their response for any apps on which you have an admin, developer, or tester role. For more information you can check [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer).
-   Please be aware that the Microsoft Graph API implements throttling to manage the volume of requests. For more information on handling throttling, refer to the [Microsoft Graph Throttling Guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/throttling).
-   Microsoft Graph API has different versions (v1.0 and beta). The v1.0 endpoint is for production use, while the beta endpoint contains features that are still in preview.
-   When requesting application permissions that require admin consent, an Azure AD administrator must pre-authorize the permissions. Without admin consent, the app cannot obtain tokens for those scopes.
-   For multitenant applications, each tenant administrator must grant consent to the app’s required permissions before access is granted in their tenant.
-  The [/.default scope](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#default-when-the-user-gives-consent) is a special scope that tells Azure AD to issue a token containing all the application permissions that have already been granted (consented) for your app on that resource. Using `/.default` ensures your app receives permissions consistent with those configured and consented at the tenant or organization level.
-   The `.default` scope can't be combined with the scopes registered in the Azure portal. So either just use the `.default` scope or remove it to list out explicit parameters that are required. If you attempt to combine them you'll receive the following error
```
.default scope can't be combined with resource-specific scopes
```
