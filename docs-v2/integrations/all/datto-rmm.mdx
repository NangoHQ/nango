## Setup guide

- When configuring your integration in Nango, the **Client ID** is set to `public-client` and the **Client Secret** is `public` by default.

### API Gotchas

- Access tokens expire after 100 hours. You will need to [re-authorize the connection](https://docs.nango.dev/guides/api-authorization/re-authorize-a-connection). Nango also supports Datto RMM (Password Grant), which automatically refreshes access tokens when they expire.
