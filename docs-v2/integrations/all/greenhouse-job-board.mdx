## API gotchas

- Job Board data is publicly available, so authentication is not required for any GET endpoints. Only the application submission endpoint `(POST https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{board_token}/jobs/{id})` which requires [Basic](https://developers.greenhouse.io/job-board.html#submit-an-application) Authentication.
- The `Basic` auth can be achieved by passing the Greenhouse (Job Board API) as the username and leaving the password field blank.
