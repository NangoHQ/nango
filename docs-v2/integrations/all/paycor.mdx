| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Paid dev account  | ✅      | You need a Paycor developer account with access to **AppCreator** to register your OAuth app and get client credentials.                                 |
| Paid test account | ❌      | Paycor provides a **sandbox environment** (`hcm-demo.paycor.com`) for testing OAuth flows — no paid test account required.                               |
| Partnership       | ✅      | You typically need to be an [approved partner](https://developers.paycor.com/join-developer-portal) to create applications. |
| App review        | ✅     | Maybe required if you want to submit your integration to the [Paycor Marketplace](https://marketplace.paycor.com/en-US/listing). |
| Security audit    | ✅     | Not required. |

## Setup guide

    2. Click **Sign Up** on the home screen for existing Paycor Clients.
    3. Click **Get Started**.
    4. Enter your Username and Password.
    5. Click **Sign In**.
    6. Select whom you would like to be the Admin of the Developer Portal Account.
    7. Click **Request Access**.
    8. Click **Sign Out**.
    9. Enter your Username and Password again.
    10. Click **Sign In**.

    > **Note**: The account creation process can take up to 5 minutes to complete. Sign out, then sign back in to access Paycor's Developer Portal.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Build your application">
    1. Click **Applications** on the home screen to get started.
    2. Click the **+ Application** button to create a new application, enter your application name.
    3. Select an **Application Type**: **Standard Application**: For general API access.
    4. Click **Create Application**
    5. **Copy & Save** the **Application OAuth Client ID** and **Application OAuth Client Secret** as you will need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
    6. Click **Got it**
    7. Navigate to the **Security Connections** tab to get your **API Subscription Key** (you will need to add this to your Nango connection configuration) and add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` as the **Approved Return OAuth URL**.
    8. Navigate to the **Data Access** tab and select your required Access scopes. This will generate a new version of the scope. You can find the **Scope Name** in the **General** tab, which you will need when configuring your integration in Nango.

## API gotchas

- **Scope Name Generation**: After selecting your required Access scopes in the Data Access tab, Paycor generates a new version of the scope. You can find the **Scope Name** in the **General** tab, which you must add to your Nango Paycor integration configuration.
- **Subscription Key Required**: You need to add your **API Subscription Key** (found in the Security Connections tab) as a connection configuration parameter in Nango for all API calls to work properly. See [creating a connect session documentation](/reference/api/connect/sessions/create#body-integrations-config-defaults) for details on how to add `subscriptionKey` to your `connection_config` when creating a Nango session.
