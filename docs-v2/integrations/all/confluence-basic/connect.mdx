# Overview

To authenticate with Confluence's REST APIs using Basic Authentication, you need:

1. **Email Address** - Your Atlassian account email address
2. **API Token** - A secure token that acts as your password for API access
3. **Subdomain** - Your Atlassian domain (e.g. your-domain.atlassian.net)

This guide will walk you through setting up Basic Authentication for Confluence.

### Prerequisites:

- An Atlassian account
- Access to your Confluence instance

#### Step 1: Getting your API Token

1. Go to [https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)

2. Click "Create Classic API token"

3. Give your token a meaningful label (e.g. "Nango Integration") and an Expiry Date

4. Click "Create"

5. Copy the API token immediately - you won't be able to see it again

Important: 
- Store this token securely and never share it. It provides the same access as your password.
- Basic authentication is not as secure as other methods. We recommend using it for scripts and manual calls to the REST APIs.

Note: As of March 13, 2024, API tokens have a lifespan of 1 to 365 days after which a new one has to be generated.

#### Step 2: Finding your Atlassian Domain

Your Atlassian domain is part of your Confluence URL. For example:

- If you access Confluence at `https://your-company.atlassian.net`
- Then your domain is `your-company`

#### Step 3: Connecting to Confluence

To authenticate:

1. Enter your Atlassian account email address
2. Enter your API token in the password field
3. Enter your Atlassian domain (without .atlassian.net)
4. Click "Connect"
