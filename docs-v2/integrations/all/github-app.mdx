## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a GitHub account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to GitHub App settings">
    1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo.
    2. Navigate to your account settings:
       - For an app owned by a personal account, click **Settings**.
       - For an app owned by an organization:
         - Click **Your organizations**.
         - To the right of the organization, click **Settings**.
    3. In the left sidebar, click **Developer settings**.
    4. In the left sidebar, click **GitHub Apps**.
    5. Click **New GitHub App**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure basic app information">
    1. Under **GitHub App name**, enter a name for your app. Choose a clear and short name (maximum 34 characters).
    2. Optionally, under **Description**, type a description of your app. Users will see this when installing your app.
    3. Under **Homepage URL**, type the full URL to your app's website. If you don't have a dedicated URL, you can use your GitHub repository URL or organization URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure callback URL (optional)">
    If your app needs to act on behalf of a user (generate a user access token):
    
    1. Under **Callback URL**, enter `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
    2. You can add up to 10 callback URLs by clicking **Add callback URL**.
    
    Note: If your app doesn't need to act on behalf of a user, this field can be left blank.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure user authorization settings (optional)">
    1. By default, **Expire user authorization tokens** is selected. GitHub recommends keeping this option enabled.
    2. If you want users to authorize your app when they install it, select **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation**.
    3. If you want to use device flow to generate a user access token, select **Enable Device Flow**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure setup URL">
    1. Under **Setup URL**, enter the URL displayed on your Nango integration page.
    2. If you selected **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation** in the previous step, you won't be able to enter a URL here.
    3. Do NOT select **Redirect on update** under **Post installation**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure webhook settings">
    1. Keep **Active** selected to receive webhook events (recommended).
    2. Under **Webhook URL**, enter the URL that GitHub should send webhook events to. If you're using Nango's webhook functionality, this will be provided by Nango.
    3. Under **Webhook secret**, enter a secure random string to secure your webhooks. Store this secret securely as you'll need it later.
    4. Under **SSL verification**, keep **Enable SSL verification** selected (recommended).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set app permissions">
    1. Under **Permissions**, choose the permissions your app needs. For each permission, select the dropdown menu and click **Read-only**, **Read & write**, or **No access**.
    2. Select the minimum permissions necessary for your app's functionality.
    3. Common permissions include:
       - **Repository**: Access to repositories
       - **Issues**: Access to issues
       - **Pull requests**: Access to pull requests
       - **Workflows**: Access to GitHub Actions workflows
       - **Organization**: Access to organization settings
    
    Note: The permissions you select will determine what webhook events are available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscribe to webhook events">
    If you kept **Active** selected for webhooks:
    
    1. Under **Subscribe to events**, select the webhook events you want your app to receive.
    2. Common webhook events include:
       - **Push**: When commits are pushed to a repository
       - **Pull request**: When pull requests are opened, closed, or modified
       - **Issues**: When issues are opened, closed, or modified
       - **Repository**: When repositories are created, deleted, or modified
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set installation options">
    Under **Where can this GitHub App be installed?**, select:
    - **Only on this account** - For apps that only you or your organization will use
    - **Any account** - For apps that will be installed by other GitHub users or organizations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the GitHub App">
    Click **Create GitHub App** to complete the registration process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate a private key">
    After creating your GitHub App:
    
    1. On your GitHub App's settings page, scroll down to the **Private keys** section.
    2. Click **Generate a private key**.
    3. A private key file will be downloaded to your computer. Store this file securely as GitHub will not store a copy.
    4. This private key will be needed when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note your App ID and installation URL">
    1. On your GitHub App's settings page, note the **App ID** at the top of the page.
    2. Also note your **App Public Link** (e.g., https://github.com/apps/your-app-name).
    3. You'll need both of these when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API gotchas

-   When setting up a GitHub App:
    - The App ID is made of numbers (e.g. 401953)
    - The App Public Link is the URL to your Github App public page (e.g. https://github.com/apps/nango-github-app)
    - The App Private Key needs to be generated in your GitHub App settings (not to be confused with the Client Secrets)
    - The Setup URL (displayed on your Nango integration page) needs to be added to your GitHub App configuration (not to be confused with the Callback URL that can stay empty)
-   There are certain API methods that only work with an OAuth App that will not work with an App. Please check the Github documentation and look for a "Works with Github Apps" header under the endpoint.
-   Nango supports initiating a connection with a GitHub App using the frontend SDK, but not directly from the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace). Therefore, you should encourage users to install your GitHub App from your product, rather than from the GitHub Marketplace directly. This is a limitation we plan to fix in the future.
-   GitHub Apps use installation tokens that are scoped to specific repositories.
-   GitHub Apps can be installed at the organization level or the repository level. The permissions and access are determined by the installation scope.
-   GitHub Apps can use both REST and GraphQL APIs, but the available endpoints depend on the permissions configured for the app.
-   When making API requests with a GitHub App, you need to authenticate as the app installation, not as the app itself.
-   Webhook payloads are signed with the webhook secret you configured. Always verify the signature to ensure the webhook is legitimate.
-   Rate limits for GitHub Apps are higher than for OAuth Apps and are based on the installation, not the user.
