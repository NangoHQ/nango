  <Tab title="🚀 Quickstart">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _GitHub App_.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize GitHub App">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to GitHub. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the GitHub API">
        Let's make your first request to the GitHub API (lists all public repositories in the order that they were created). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/repositories" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
                ```

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            const res = await nango.get({
                endpoint: '/repositories',
                providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
                connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
            });

            console.log(res.data);
            ```
            </Tab>

        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.

    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="🧑‍💻 OAuth app setup">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a GitHub account">
        If you don't already have one, sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Navigate to GitHub App settings">
        1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo.
        2. Navigate to your account settings:
           - For an app owned by a personal account, click **Settings**.
           - For an app owned by an organization:
             - Click **Your organizations**.
             - To the right of the organization, click **Settings**.
        3. In the left sidebar, click **Developer settings**.
        4. In the left sidebar, click **GitHub Apps**.
        5. Click **New GitHub App**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure basic app information">
        1. Under **GitHub App name**, enter a name for your app. Choose a clear and short name (maximum 34 characters).
        2. Optionally, under **Description**, type a description of your app. Users will see this when installing your app.
        3. Under **Homepage URL**, type the full URL to your app's website. If you don't have a dedicated URL, you can use your GitHub repository URL or organization URL.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure callback URL (optional)">
        If your app needs to act on behalf of a user (generate a user access token):

        1. Under **Callback URL**, enter `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
        2. You can add up to 10 callback URLs by clicking **Add callback URL**.

        Note: If your app doesn't need to act on behalf of a user, this field can be left blank.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure user authorization settings (optional)">
        1. By default, **Expire user authorization tokens** is selected. GitHub recommends keeping this option enabled.
        2. If you want users to authorize your app when they install it, select **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation**.
        3. If you want to use device flow to generate a user access token, select **Enable Device Flow**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure setup URL">
        1. Under **Setup URL**, enter the URL displayed on your Nango integration page.
        2. If you selected **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation** in the previous step, you won't be able to enter a URL here.
        3. Do NOT select **Redirect on update** under **Post installation**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure webhook settings">
        1. Keep **Active** selected to receive webhook events (recommended).
        2. Under **Webhook URL**, enter the URL that GitHub should send webhook events to. If you're using Nango's webhook functionality, this will be provided by Nango.
        3. Under **Webhook secret**, enter a secure random string to secure your webhooks. Store this secret securely as you'll need it later.
        4. Under **SSL verification**, keep **Enable SSL verification** selected (recommended).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set app permissions">
        1. Under **Permissions**, choose the permissions your app needs. For each permission, select the dropdown menu and click **Read-only**, **Read & write**, or **No access**.
        2. Select the minimum permissions necessary for your app's functionality.
        3. Common permissions include:
           - **Repository**: Access to repositories
           - **Issues**: Access to issues
           - **Pull requests**: Access to pull requests
           - **Workflows**: Access to GitHub Actions workflows
           - **Organization**: Access to organization settings

        Note: The permissions you select will determine what webhook events are available.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Subscribe to webhook events">
        If you kept **Active** selected for webhooks:

        1. Under **Subscribe to events**, select the webhook events you want your app to receive.
        2. Common webhook events include:
           - **Push**: When commits are pushed to a repository
           - **Pull request**: When pull requests are opened, closed, or modified
           - **Issues**: When issues are opened, closed, or modified
           - **Repository**: When repositories are created, deleted, or modified
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set installation options">
        Under **Where can this GitHub App be installed?**, select:
        - **Only on this account** - For apps that only you or your organization will use
        - **Any account** - For apps that will be installed by other GitHub users or organizations
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create the GitHub App">
        Click **Create GitHub App** to complete the registration process.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Generate a private key">
        After creating your GitHub App:

        1. On your GitHub App's settings page, scroll down to the **Private keys** section.
        2. Click **Generate a private key**.
        3. A private key file will be downloaded to your computer. Store this file securely as GitHub will not store a copy.
        4. This private key will be needed when configuring your integration in Nango.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Note your App ID and installation URL">
        1. On your GitHub App's settings page, note the **App ID** at the top of the page.
        2. Also note your **App Public Link** (e.g., https://github.com/apps/your-app-name).
        3. You'll need both of these when configuring your integration in Nango.

  <Tab title="🚨 API gotchas">
    - When setting up a GitHub App:
      - The App ID is made of numbers (e.g. 401953)
      - The App Public Link is the URL to your Github App public page (e.g. https://github.com/apps/nango-github-app)
      - The App Private Key needs to be generated in your GitHub App settings (not to be confused with the Client Secrets)
      - The Setup URL (displayed on your Nango integration page) needs to be added to your GitHub App configuration (not to be confused with the Callback URL that can stay empty)
    - There are certain API methods that only work with an OAuth App that will not work with an App. Please check the Github documentation and look for a "Works with Github Apps" header under the endpoint.
    - Nango supports initiating a connection with a GitHub App using the frontend SDK, but not directly from the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace). Therefore, you should encourage users to install your GitHub App from your product, rather than from the GitHub Marketplace directly. This is a limitation we plan to fix in the future.
    - GitHub Apps use installation tokens that are scoped to specific repositories.
    - GitHub Apps can be installed at the organization level or the repository level. The permissions and access are determined by the installation scope.
    - GitHub Apps can use both REST and GraphQL APIs, but the available endpoints depend on the permissions configured for the app.
    - When making API requests with a GitHub App, you need to authenticate as the app installation, not as the app itself.
    - Webhook payloads are signed with the webhook secret you configured. Always verify the signature to ensure the webhook is legitimate.
    - Rate limits for GitHub Apps are higher than for OAuth Apps and are based on the installation, not the user.
