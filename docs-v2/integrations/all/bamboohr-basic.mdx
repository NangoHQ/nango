## Connection configuration in Nango

- BambooHR requires a user specific subdomain to authenticate

## API gotchas

- Authenticating via API key: BambooHR gives only an `API Key` but uses Basic auth for the API. Pass the `API Key` as the username and use `x` for the password. See BambooHR [documentation](https://documentation.bamboohr.com/docs#section-authentication)
