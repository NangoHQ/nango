## Connection configuration in Nango

Freshdesk requires a user specific subdomain for the API requests.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('freshdesk', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {
    params: {
        subdomain: '<freshdesk-subdomain>'
    },
    credentials: {
            username: '<API-KEY>',
            password: 'x' // freshdesk asks you to leave "x" here
    }});
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

- For Basic Auth, Freshdesk uses API key as a username and dummy characters as a password.
- API calls are directed to your subdomain of Freshdesk.
