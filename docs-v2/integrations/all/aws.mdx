## Setup guide

AWS offers multiple authentication methods. This guide covers two main approaches:

### AWS IAM (Basic Auth)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an AWS account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an IAM user">
    1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).
    2. Navigate to the IAM service by searching for "IAM" in the search bar.
    3. In the left navigation pane, choose **Users**, then **Create user**.
    4. Enter a user name and select **Next**.
    5. On the permissions page, select **Attach policies directly**.
    6. Search for and select the policies that grant the necessary permissions for your integration. For example, you might need `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` for S3 access.
    7. Choose **Next**, review your choices, and then select **Create user**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create access keys">
    1. From the list of users, select the user you just created.
    2. Select the **Security credentials** tab.
    3. Under **Access keys**, choose **Create access key**.
    4. Select **Application running outside AWS** as the use case, then click **Next**.
    5. (Optional) Add a description tag, then click **Create access key**.
    6. On the final page, you'll see your **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**. Make sure to download the .csv file or copy these values, as you won't be able to view the secret access key again.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your integration in Nango">
    When setting up your AWS IAM integration in Nango:
    
    - Use your **Access key ID** as the username
    - Use your **Secret access key** as the password
    - Specify the AWS region in your connection configuration (e.g., `us-east-1`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### AWS Cognito (OAuth 2.0)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an AWS account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Cognito User Pool">
    1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).
    2. Navigate to the Amazon Cognito service by searching for "Cognito" in the search bar.
    3. Choose **User Pools** from the left navigation pane.
    4. Select **Create user pool**.
    5. Choose the authentication providers you want to use. For OAuth integration, select **Cognito user pool** as the provider.
    6. Configure the security requirements, including password policy and MFA settings.
    7. Configure sign-up experience and required attributes.
    8. Configure message delivery for verification emails and SMS.
    9. Integrate your app by giving it a name and configuring the app client.
    10. Review all settings and create the user pool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the App Client">
    1. After creating the user pool, navigate to the **App integration** tab.
    2. Under **App clients and analytics**, select **Create app client**.
    3. Choose **Confidential client** for server-side applications.
    4. Enter a name for your app client.
    5. Set the **Refresh token expiration** as needed (default is 30 days).
    6. Under **Allowed callback URLs**, add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
    7. Select the **OAuth 2.0 grant types** you need (typically Authorization code grant).
    8. Under **OpenID Connect scopes**, select the scopes your application requires.
    9. Choose **Create app client**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure a Domain">
    1. Still in the **App integration** tab, under **Domain**, choose **Actions** and then **Create custom domain** or **Create Cognito domain**.
    2. For a Cognito domain, enter a domain prefix.
    3. For a custom domain, enter your domain name and upload an SSL certificate.
    4. Choose **Create**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OAuth Settings">
    1. In the **App integration** tab, under **Hosted UI**, choose **Edit**.
    2. Configure the identity providers you want to use.
    3. Set the callback URL to `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
    4. Select the OAuth scopes you need.
    5. Choose **Save changes**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain Client Credentials">
    1. Navigate to the **App clients and analytics** section.
    2. Select your app client from the list.
    3. Note your **Client ID**.
    4. Click **Show client secret** to view and copy your client secret.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your integration in Nango">
    When setting up your AWS Cognito integration in Nango:
    
    - Use your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
    - For the OAuth authorization URL, use: `https://{your-domain}.auth.{region}.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/authorize`
    - For the token URL, use: `https://{your-domain}.auth.{region}.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token`
    - Replace `{your-domain}` with your Cognito domain prefix and `{region}` with your AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>
