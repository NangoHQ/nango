## Connection configuration in Nango

- AWS uses different domain extensions codes for different regions, i.e `us-east-2` for the US East (Ohio) region, `us-east-1` for the US East (N. Virginia) region, or `eu-west-1` for Europe (Ireland) region.It also uses different subdomains for different `user pools`.
- Please provide your `apiSubdomain`, which is the endpoint subdomain to the specific Amazon Cognito API. For example, for the `US East (Ohio)` region (user) pools, the subdomain would be `idp.us-east-2`. You can reference the Amazon Cognito [Service Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/cognito_identity.html#cognito_identity_region) documentation to find the appropriate endpoint for your specific use case.
