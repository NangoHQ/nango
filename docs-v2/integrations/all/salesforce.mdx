    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Salesforce_.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Salesforce">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Salesforce. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Salesforce API">
        Let's make your first request to the Salesforce API (fetch a list of contacts). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/services/data/v58.0/query?q=SELECT+Id,FirstName,LastName,Email+FROM+Contact+LIMIT+10" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
                ```

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            const res = await nango.get({
                endpoint: '/services/data/v58.0/query',
                params: { q: "SELECT Id,FirstName,LastName,Email FROM Contact LIMIT 10" },
                providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
                connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
            });

            console.log(res.data);
            ```
            </Tab>


        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.

  ## Connected App

  <Steps>
     <Step title="Sign up for a Salesforce developer edition account">
       If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Salesforce Developer Edition account](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup).
     </Step>
    <Step title="Enable Connected Apps">
      **Note:** Connected Apps are disabled by default in new Salesforce organizations. If your organization is creating one, follow these steps to enable them first. If your organization has already enabled this setting, skip to **Configure Connected App settings**.
      1. Log in to your Salesforce account
      2. Navigate to **Setup**. In the left menu, go to **Apps** → **External Client App Manager** → **Settings**
      3. Find the **Allow creation of connected apps** option then toggle it to enable **Connected Apps**
    </Step>
      <Step title="Configure Connected App settings">
        1. Log in to your [Salesforce Developer Edition account](https://login.salesforce.com/)
        2. Navigate to **Setup**. In the left menu, go to **Apps** → **External Client App Manager** → **Settings**. Scroll to the bottom of the page, then click **New Connected App**
        3. Fill in the required basic information:
           - **Connected App Name**: Your app's name
           - **API Name**: This will auto-populate
           - **Contact Email**: Your email address
        4. Check the **Enable OAuth Settings** checkbox.
        5. For **Callback URL**, enter: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
        6. Under **Selected OAuth Scopes**, add the permissions your app needs. At minimum, add:
           - `Access and manage your data (api)`
           - `Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)`
        7. Check the **Introspect All Tokens** option
        8. Leave the rest of the default settings unchanged.
        9. Click **Save**, then **Continue**.
        <Note>Changes can take up to 10 minutes to take effect</Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Obtain API credentials">
        1. After saving your changes, you'll be redirected to the Connected App detail page.
        2. You may need to wait a few minutes for the app to be fully created.
        3. Click **Manage Consumer Details** to view your credentials. You may be required to verify your identity.
        4. Copy the **Consumer Key** (this is your Client ID) and **Consumer Secret** (this is your Client Secret).
        5. You will need these credentials when configuring your integration in Nango.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure token settings">
        1. Under the **Connected Apps** dropdown, click **Manage Connected Apps**, then click the **Edit** button next to the application you just created.
        2. Under **OAuth Policies**, set **Refresh Token Policy** to **Refresh token is valid until revoked** for long-lived access.
        3. Click **Save**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Next">
        Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  ## External Client Apps

  - In the summer of 2025, Salesforce released [External Client Apps](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.external_client_apps.htm&type=5), an alternative authentication method that allows external applications to connect to Salesforce orgs. Nango fully supports this as well.
  - However, they require packaging and end-users must install them in their Salesforce org to work. For the most frictionless integration experience, Nango recommends using **Connected Apps**.
  - To see how they compare to Connected Apps, check out [Salesforce's comparison guide](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_apps_and_external_client_apps_features.htm&language=en_US&type=5).
  - To learn how to create External Client Apps, see [Salesforce's creation guide](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.create_a_local_external_client_app.htm&type=5). You can also reach out to our community to learn more about setting these up.

  <Tab title="🚨 API gotchas">
    -   **External Client Apps vs Connected Apps**: Salesforce has transitioned from Connected Apps to External Client Apps. You must choose the Distribution State (Local vs Packaged) upfront. If distributing to other organizations, you need separate accounts for Dev Hub and namespace registration, and must follow the packaging process outlined in the Oauth Setup guide.
    -   If you or your end-user are authorizing a Salesforce sandbox account, you must use the `salesforce-sandbox` integration in Nango. Your Salesforce Developer Edition account is **not** a Salesforce sandbox! Use it with the regular `salesforce` connector.
    -   Salesforce calls the `client_id` and `client_secret` as `Consumer Key` and `Consumer Secret`.
    -   To enable offline data access with a refresh token, add the `refresh_token` (or its synonym, `offline_access`) scope. By default, access tokens expire in ~2h (but customers can configure this value). Also, check the "Introspect All Tokens" checkbox in your OAuth app settings on the Salesforce developer portal (Salesforce doesn't share the expiration date of access tokens. Instead, Nango needs to call the Salesforce API to check if access tokens are valid.)
    -   If you encounter an error in your flow that says `invalid_client_id`, [make sure your (developer) User's password does not contain any special characters](https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=906F00000009ABLIA2) (yes, really.)
