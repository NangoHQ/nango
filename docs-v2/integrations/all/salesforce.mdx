## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Salesforce Developer account">
    Go to [Salesforce Developer Edition signup page](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) and create a free account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an External Client App">
    1. Log in to your Salesforce account.
    2. Click on the **Setup** menu, in the **Quick Find** box, enter **App Manager**, and then select **App Manager**.
    3. Click **New External Client App**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure External Client App settings">
    1. Fill in the required **Basic information**:
       - **External Client App Name**: The display name of your app as it will appear in Salesforce.
       - **API Name**: Auto-filled based on the app name; used internally by Salesforce.
       - **Contact Email**: The email address Salesforce can use to contact the app owner.
       - **Distribution State**: Choose how the app will be used:
        1. **Local** – Use this if the app is only for development or internal use within your Salesforce org.
        2. **Packaged** – Use this if the app will be distributed or installed in other Salesforce orgs.
       - **Contact Phone (Optional)**: A phone number for reaching the app's designated point of contact.
       - **Info URL (Optional)**: A link to your app’s website or documentation.
       - **Logo Image URL (Optional)**: A direct URL to an image that will be used as the app’s logo.
       - **Icon URL (Optional)**: A direct URL to a smaller icon representing the app.
       - **Description (Optional)**: A short summary describing what the app does.
    2. Check the **API (Enable Oauth Settings)** checkbox.
    3. For **Callback URL**, enter: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
    4. Under **Selected OAuth Scopes**, add the permissions your app needs. At minimum, add:
       - "Access and manage your data (api)"
       - "Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)"
    5. Under **Flow Enablement**, check **Enable Authorization Code and Credentials Flow**.
    6. Under **Security**, leave the default options selected:
        - ✅ Require secret for Web Server Flow
        - ✅ Require secret for Refresh Token Flow
        - ✅ Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) extension for Supported Authorization Flows
    7. Click **Create**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain API credentials">
    1. After saving, navigate to your app **Settings** tab.
    2. Scroll down to **Oauth Settings** section.
    3. Click **Consumer Key and Secret** to view your credentials. You may be required to verify your identity.
    4. Copy the **Consumer Key** (this is your Client ID) and **Consumer Secret** (this is your Client Secret).
    5. You will need these credentials when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure token settings (recommended)">
    1. Click your app's **Policies** tab, then click the **Edit** button. Scroll down to **OAuth Policies**, and under **App Authorization**, set the **Refresh Token Policy** to "Refresh token is valid until revoked" for long-lived access.
    2. Click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Already using a Connected App? Migrate to External Client App">
    If you previously created a **Connected App**, you can migrate it to an **External Client App** that Salesforce recommends. Note that **Connected Apps** are now disabled by default in all new Salesforce orgs.
    
    1. From **Setup**, go to **App Manager** and open the connected app.
    2. If eligible, click the **Migrate to External Client App** button.
    3. Confirm that the app is local and doesn't use the username-password flow.
    4. Click **Migrate**.
    5. A new External Client App will be created, and the old Connected App will remain in read-only mode.
    <Note>All changes must be made in the new external client app. Deleting the external client app reactivates the original connected app, but with its previous settings intact.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API gotchas

-   If you or your end-user are authorizing a Salesforce sandbox account, you must use the `salesforce-sandbox` integration in Nango. Your Salesforce Developer Edition account is **not** a Salesforce sandbox! Use it with the regular `salesforce` connector.
-   Salesforce calls the `client_id` and `client_secret` as `Consumer Key` and `Consumer Secret`.
-   To enable offline data access with a refresh token, add the `refresh_token` (or its synonym, `offline_access`) scope. By default, access tokens expire in ~2h (but customers can configure this value). Also, check the "Introspect All Tokens" checkbox in your OAuth app settings on the Salesforce developer portal (Salesforce doesn't share the expiration date of access tokens. Instead, Nango needs to call the Salesforce API to check if access tokens are valid.)
-   If you encounter an error in your flow that says `invalid_client_id`, [make sure your (developer) User's password does not contain any special characters](https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=906F00000009ABLIA2) (yes, really.)
