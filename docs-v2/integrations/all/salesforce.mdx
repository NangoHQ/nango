  ## Key Changes: Connected Apps vs External Client Apps
  
  **Important:** Salesforce has transitioned from **Connected Apps** to **External Client Apps**. Here's what changed:
  
  - **Connected Apps**: Could be used for both internal (same org) and external (different orgs) purposes without upfront decision.
  - **External Client Apps** (current): You must choose the **Distribution State** upfront:
    - **Local**: For internal use within your Salesforce org only
    - **Packaged**: For distribution to other Salesforce orgs (requires packaging and installation process)

  This guide covers both scenarios. Choose the appropriate section based on your needs.

  ## Prerequisites 
  - Salesforce **External Client Apps** are only available in the following editions: Professional, Performance, Unlimited, Developer. 
  - A user account with the **Create, Edit, and Delete External Client Apps** permission is also required.

  ## Option A: Internal Use (Local Distribution)
  
  Use this option if your app will only be used within your own Salesforce org.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a Salesforce Developer account">
        Go to [Salesforce Developer Edition signup page](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) and create a free account.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create an External Client App">
        1. Log in to your Salesforce account.
        2. Click on the **Setup** menu, in the **Quick Find** box, enter **App Manager**, and then select **App Manager**.
        3. Click **New External Client App**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure External Client App settings">
      1. Fill in the required **Basic information**:
       - **External Client App Name**: The display name of your app as it will appear in Salesforce.
       - **API Name**: Auto-filled based on the app name; used internally by Salesforce.
       - **Contact Email**: The email address Salesforce can use to contact the app owner.
       - **Distribution State**: Select **Local** for internal use within your Salesforce org.
       - **Contact Phone (Optional)**: A phone number for reaching the app's designated point of contact.
       - **Info URL (Optional)**: A link to your app's website or documentation.
       - **Logo Image URL (Optional)**: A direct URL to an image that will be used as the app's logo.
       - **Icon URL (Optional)**: A direct URL to a smaller icon representing the app.
       - **Description (Optional)**: A short summary describing what the app does.
      2. Check the **API (Enable Oauth Settings)** checkbox.
      3. For **Callback URL**, enter: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
      4. Under **Selected OAuth Scopes**, add the permissions your app needs. At minimum, add:
        - "Access and manage your data (api)"
        - "Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)"
      5. Under **Flow Enablement**, check **Enable Authorization Code and Credentials Flow**.
      6. Under **Security**, leave the default options selected:
          - ✅ Require secret for Web Server Flow
          - ✅ Require secret for Refresh Token Flow
          - ✅ Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) extension for Supported Authorization Flows
      7. Click **Create**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Obtain API credentials">
        1. After saving, navigate to your app **Settings** tab.
        2. Scroll down to **Oauth Settings** section.
        3. Click **Consumer Key and Secret** to view your credentials. You may be required to verify your identity.
        4. Copy the **Consumer Key** (this is your Client ID) and **Consumer Secret** (this is your Client Secret).
        5. You will need these credentials when configuring your integration in Nango.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure token settings (recommended)">
       1. Click your app's **Policies** tab, then click the **Edit** button. Scroll down to **OAuth Policies**, and under **App Authorization**, set the **Refresh Token Policy** to "Refresh token is valid until revoked" for long-lived access.
       2. Click **Save**.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  ## Option B: External Distribution (Packaged Distribution)
  
  Use this option if your app will be distributed to other Salesforce orgs. This requires a more complex setup with packaging.

  ### Environment Setup Requirements
  
  **Important**: Due to [Salesforce limitations](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/feed/0D54V00007T44UpSAJ), you need **two separate Salesforce accounts**:
  - **Developer Hub (Dev Hub) Account**: For creating and managing packages.
  - **Namespace Account**: The Namespace Account is used to register and manage a unique namespace for packaging and publishing apps. 
  
  You cannot have both Dev Hub enabled and register a namespace in the same org.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Set up two Salesforce accounts">
        1. **Create Developer Hub Account**: 
           - Go to [Salesforce Developer Edition signup](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) and create your first account
           - Enable Dev Hub: **Setup** → **Dev Hub** → **Enable Dev Hub**
           <Note>Please note that this change is irreversible</Note>
        
        2. **Create Namespace Account**: 
           - Create a second Salesforce Developer Edition account
           - Register a namespace: **Setup** → **Package Manager** → **Register Namespace**
           - Choose a unique namespace (this will be part of your package identity)
        
        3. **Link the namespace to your Dev Hub account**:
           - Log in to your **Dev Hub org** as the System Administrator or as a user with the Salesforce DX Namespace Registry permissions.
           <Tip>Make sure your browser allows pop-ups from your Dev Hub org</Tip>
           - From the App Launcher menu, select **Namespace Registries**
           - Click **Link Namespace**
           - In the pop-up window that appears, log in to your **Namespace Account** (the Developer Edition org where your namespace is registered) using the System Administrator's credentials.
           - After successful linking, you can view all linked namespaces by selecting the **All Namespace Registries** list view.
           
           <Note>You can't link orgs without a namespace - sandboxes, scratch orgs, patch orgs, and branch orgs require a namespace to be linked to the Namespace Registry.</Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create External Client App in Developer Hub (Dev Hub)">
        1. Log in to your **Developer Hub (Dev Hub)** (the first account).
        2. Click on **Setup** → **App Manager** → **New External Client App**.
        3. Configure the app settings:
            - **External Client App Name**: The display name of your app as it will appear in Salesforce.
            - **API Name**: Auto-filled based on the app name; used internally by Salesforce.
            - **Contact Email**: The email address Salesforce can use to contact the app owner.
            - **Distribution State**: Select **Packaged**.
            - **Contact Phone (Optional)**: A phone number for reaching the app's designated point of contact.
            - **Info URL (Optional)**: A link to your app's website or documentation.
            - **Logo Image URL (Optional)**: A direct URL to an image that will be used as the app's logo.
            - **Icon URL (Optional)**: A direct URL to a smaller icon representing the app.
            - **Description (Optional)**: A short summary describing what the app does.
        4. Enable OAuth settings:
           - Check **API (Enable Oauth Settings)**
           - **Callback URL**: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
           - **Selected OAuth Scopes**: Add required scopes (minimum: "api", "refresh_token, offline_access")
           - **Flow Enablement**: Enable Authorization Code and Credentials Flow
           - Under **Security**, leave the default options selected:
             . ✅ Require secret for Web Server Flow
             . ✅ Require secret for Refresh Token Flow
             . ✅ Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) extension for Supported Authorization Flows
        5. Click **Create**.
        6. After saving, navigate to your app **Settings** tab.
        7. Scroll down to **Oauth Settings** section.
        8. Click **Consumer Key and Secret** to view your credentials. You may be required to verify your identity.
        9. Copy the **Consumer Key** (this is your Client ID) and **Consumer Secret** (this is your Client Secret). You will need these credentials when configuring your integration in Nango.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure token settings (recommended)">
       1. Click your app's **Policies** tab, then click the **Edit** button. Scroll down to **OAuth Policies**, and under **App Authorization**, set the **Refresh Token Policy** to "Refresh token is valid until revoked" for long-lived access.
       2. Click **Save**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Install and set up Salesforce CLI">
        1. **Install Salesforce CLI**:
           - **Mac**: `brew install salesforce-cli` or download from [Salesforce CLI releases](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/salesforcecli)
           - **Windows**: Download the installer from [Salesforce CLI releases](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/salesforcecli)
           - **Linux**: Use npm: `npm install -g @salesforce/cli` or download from [Salesforce CLI releases](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/salesforcecli)
        
        2. **Verify installation**:
           ```bash
           sf --version
           ```
        
        3. **Login to your Developer Hub account**:
           ```bash
           sf org login web --set-default-dev-hub --alias my-dev-hub
           ```
           This will open a browser window where you can login to your **Developer Hub account** (the first account you created).
        
        4. **Verify login and see connected orgs**:
           ```bash
           sf org list
           ```
           You should see your Dev Hub org listed with a "(D)" indicating it's set as the default Dev Hub.
        
        5. **Create a Salesforce project**:
           ```bash
           sf project generate --name nango
           cd nango
           ```
           This creates a new Salesforce project directory structure that we'll use for packaging.
        6. **Open the project in your IDE**:
           Open the `nango` project folder in your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code):
           ```bash
           code .
           ```
        7. **Create package.xml file**:
           In the project root directory, create a `package.xml` file with the following configuration:
           ```xml
           <Package xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata">
               <types>
                   <members>*</members>
                   <name>ExternalClientApplication</name>
               </types>
               <types>
                   <members>*</members>
                   <name>ExtlClntAppOauthSettings</name>
               </types>
               <!--  Add this section if you Configured token settings policies above. -->
               <types>
                <members>*</members>
                <name>ExtlClntAppOauthConfigurablePolicies</name>
              </types>
               <version>58.0</version>
           </Package>
           ```
           This package.xml defines the metadata types we'll be working with for External Client Apps and their OAuth settings.
        
        8. **Retrieve the External Client App from Dev Hub**:
           Now retrieve the External Client App you created in the Dev Hub account using the following command:
           ```bash
           sf project retrieve start --manifest package.xml --target-org johndoe@example.com
           ```
           Replace `johndoe@example.com` with the username of your authenticated Dev Hub account. This command retrieves the External Client App metadata and OAuth settings into your local project. This will add 2 folders **(externalClientApps and extlClntAppOauthSettings)** in your `force-app/main/default/` folder of the project you are working on. If you enabled ExtlClntAppOauthConfigurablePolicies in the XML, you will get 3 folders instead, with the third being **extlClntAppOauthConfigurablePolicies**.
           
           <Note>If you have more external client apps registered, they will also be added. You can remove them by deleting the specific files inside those folders to remain with the packaged one we created earlier.</Note>
        
        9. **Configure sfdx-project.json and create package version**:
           First, get the package ID by running:
           ```bash
           sf package list --target-dev-hub my-dev-hub
           ```
           
           Open the `sfdx-project.json` file in the root of your project and configure it like this:
           ```json
           {
             "packageDirectories": [
               {
                 "versionName": "ver 0.1", // this is the version number
                 "versionNumber": "0.1.0.NEXT", // auto-incrementing version format
                 "path": "force-app",
                 "default": true,
                 "package": "Nango External App", // package name reference
                 "versionDescription": "" // optional description for this version
               }
             ],
             "name": "my-app", // project name
             "namespace": "<YOUR_NAMESPACE>", // your registered namespace
             "sfdcLoginUrl": "https://login.salesforce.com",
             "sourceApiVersion": "64.0",
             "packageAliases": {
               "Nango External App": "<PACKAGE_ID>" // maps package name to package ID
             }
           }
           ```
           Replace `<PACKAGE_ID>` with the ID obtained from the previous command and `<YOUR_NAMESPACE>` with the namespace you linked to your Dev Hub account.
           
           Then create a package version:
           ```bash
           sf package version create --package <PACKAGE_ID> --installation-key "" --wait 20 --code-coverage --target-dev-hub my-dev-hub
           ```
           You can leave `--installation-key ""` empty to make the package installation open, or provide a key that users will need to enter during installation.
           
           After successfully creating the package, you will get a successful message with an installation URL that you can use to distribute your External Client App to other Salesforce orgs.
        
        10. **Install the package to target org**:
            Use the installation URL above to install your package to the target Salesforce org where you want to use the External Client App. 
      </Step>
     </Steps>

  ## Already using a Connected App? Migrate to External Client App
  
  If you previously created a **Connected App**, you can migrate it to an **External Client App** that Salesforce recommends. Note that **Connected Apps** are now disabled by default in all new Salesforce orgs.

  1. From **Setup**, go to **App Manager** and open the connected app.
  2. If eligible, click the **Migrate to External Client App** button.
  3. Confirm that the app is local and doesn't use the username-password flow.
  4. Click **Migrate**.
  5. A new External Client App will be created, and the old Connected App will remain in read-only mode.
  
  <Note>All changes must be made in the new external client app. Deleting the external client app reactivates the original connected app, but with its previous settings intact.</Note>

  ## Next Steps
  
  After completing either Option A or Option B above, follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to start using your Salesforce integration.

  <Tab title="🚨 API gotchas">
    -   **External Client Apps vs Connected Apps**: Salesforce has transitioned from Connected Apps to External Client Apps. You must choose the Distribution State (Local vs Packaged) upfront. If distributing to other orgs, you need separate accounts for Dev Hub and namespace registration, and must follow the packaging process outlined in Option B above.
    -   If you or your end-user are authorizing a Salesforce sandbox account, you must use the `salesforce-sandbox` integration in Nango. Your Salesforce Developer Edition account is **not** a Salesforce sandbox! Use it with the regular `salesforce` connector.
    -   Salesforce calls the `client_id` and `client_secret` as `Consumer Key` and `Consumer Secret`.
    -   To enable offline data access with a refresh token, add the `refresh_token` (or its synonym, `offline_access`) scope. By default, access tokens expire in ~2h (but customers can configure this value). Also, check the "Introspect All Tokens" checkbox in your OAuth app settings on the Salesforce developer portal (Salesforce doesn't share the expiration date of access tokens. Instead, Nango needs to call the Salesforce API to check if access tokens are valid.)
    -   If you encounter an error in your flow that says `invalid_client_id`, [make sure your (developer) User's password does not contain any special characters](https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=906F00000009ABLIA2) (yes, really.)
