  ## Connected Apps vs External Client Apps
    **Important:** Salesforce is transitioning from **Connected Apps** to **External Client Apps** as the next generation of Connected Apps. Nango supports both options, but for the most frictionless integration experience, **we recommend using Connected Apps** for most use cases.


  **Connected Apps** (Recommended for most users):
  - ‚úÖ **Easier setup** - Just enable in settings and create directly from your org
  - ‚úÖ **No packaging required** - Works immediately after creation
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disabled by default** in newly created Salesforce organizations, but can be easily enabled

  **External Client Apps** (Advanced option):
  - ‚ùå **Requires packaging** - Must be packaged and distributed
  - ‚ùå **End-users must install** - Customers need to install the package in their org for this to work
  - ‚ùå **Higher technical complexity** - Requires Dev Hub setup and namespace management

  ### Prerequisites 
  - Salesforce **External Client Apps** are only available in the following editions: Professional, Performance, Unlimited and Developer. 
  - A user account with the **Create, Edit, and Delete External Client Apps** permission is also required.
  
  ## Creating a Connected App (Recommended)
  
  **Note:** Connected Apps are disabled by default in new Salesforce organizations. Follow these steps to enable them first:
  
  ### Step 1: Enable Connected Apps in Your Salesforce Org

      </Step>
      <Step title="Next">
        Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  <Info>
    **Alternative: External Client Apps** - Nango also supports Salesforce's newer External Client Apps, but they require packaging and end-users must install them in their Salesforce org. For the most frictionless integration experience, we recommend using Connected Apps above. Only use External Client Apps if you need to distribute your app to multiple Salesforce organizations.
  </Info>

  ## Creating an External Client App for Internal Use (Local Distribution)

      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure token settings">
       1. Click on your app's **Policies** tab, then click the **Edit** button. Scroll down to **OAuth Policies**, and under **App Authorization**, set the **Refresh Token Policy** to **Refresh token is valid until revoked** for long-lived access.
       2. Click **Save**.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  ## Creating an External Client App for External Distribution (Packaged Distribution)
  
  Use this option if your app will be distributed to other Salesforce organizations. This requires a more complex setup with packaging.

  ### Environment Setup Requirements
  
  **Important**: Due to [Salesforce limitations](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/feed/0D54V00007T44UpSAJ), you need **two separate Salesforce accounts**:
  - **Developer Hub (Dev Hub) Account**: For creating and managing packages.
  - **Namespace Account**: Used to register and manage a unique namespace for packaging and publishing apps.
   
  You cannot have both Dev Hub enabled and register a namespace in the same organization.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Setting up two Salesforce accounts">
        1. **Create Developer Hub Account**: 
           - Go to [Salesforce Developer Edition signup](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) and create your first account
           - Enable Dev Hub: Click on the **Setup** menu, then search for and select **Dev Hub** in the Quick Find box then toggle the **Enable Dev Hub** option
           - Enable 2GP: On the same page, toggle the **Enable Unlocked Packages and Second-Generation Managed Packages** option
           <Note>Please note that this change is irreversible</Note>
        
        2. **Create Namespace Account**: 
           - Create a second [Salesforce Developer Edition](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) account
           - Register a namespace: Click on the Setup menu, then search for and select **Package Manager**, and finally click on **Register Namespace**
           - Choose a unique namespace (this will be part of your package identity)
        
        3. **Link the namespace to your Dev Hub account**:
           - Log in to your **Dev Hub organization** as the System Administrator or as a user with the Salesforce DX Namespace Registry permissions.
           <Tip>Make sure your browser allows pop-ups from your Dev Hub organization</Tip>
           - From the App Launcher menu, select **Namespace Registries**
           - Click **Link Namespace**
           - In the pop-up window that appears, log in to your **Namespace Account** (the Developer Edition organization where your namespace is registered) using the System Administrator's credentials.
           - After successful linking, you can view all linked namespaces by selecting the **All Namespace Registries** list view.
           
           <Note>You can't link organizations without a namespace - sandboxes, scratch organizations, patch organizations, and branch organizations require a namespace to be linked to the Namespace Registry.</Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create External Client App in Developer Hub (Dev Hub)">
        1. Log in to your **Developer Hub (Dev Hub)** (the first account).
        2. Click on the **Setup** menu, then search for and select **External Client App**, and finally click on **New External Client App**.
        3. Configure the app settings:
            - **External Client App Name**: The display name of your app as it will appear in Salesforce.
            - **API Name**: This is auto-filled based on the app name; used internally by Salesforce.
            - **Contact Email**: The email address Salesforce can use to contact the app owner.
            - **Distribution State**: Select **Packaged**.
            - **Contact Phone (Optional)**: A phone number for reaching the app's designated point of contact.
            - **Info URL (Optional)**: A link to your app's website or documentation.
            - **Logo Image URL (Optional)**: A direct URL to an image that will be used as the app's logo.
            - **Icon URL (Optional)**: A direct URL to a smaller icon representing the app.
            - **Description (Optional)**: A short summary describing what the app does.
        4. Enable OAuth settings:
           - Check **API (Enable Oauth Settings)**
           - **Callback URL**: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
           - **Selected OAuth Scopes**: Add required scopes (minimum: `api`, `refresh_token, offline_access`)
           - **Introspect all Tokens**: Enable this option by checking the box
           - **Flow Enablement**: Enable Authorization Code and Credentials Flow
           - Under **Security**, leave the default options selected:
             . ‚úÖ Require secret for Web Server Flow
             . ‚úÖ Require secret for Refresh Token Flow
             . ‚úÖ Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) extension for Supported Authorization Flows
        5. Click **Create**.
        6. After saving, navigate to your app **Settings** tab.
        7. Scroll down to **Oauth Settings** section.
        8. Click **Consumer Key and Secret** to view your credentials. You may be required to verify your identity.
        9. Copy the **Consumer Key** (this is your Client ID) and **Consumer Secret** (this is your Client Secret). You will need these credentials when configuring your integration in Nango.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure token settings">
       1. Click your app's **Policies** tab, then click the **Edit** button. Scroll down to **OAuth Policies**, and under **App Authorization**, set the **Refresh Token Policy** to **Refresh token is valid until revoked** for long-lived access.
       2. Click **Save**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Install and set up Salesforce CLI">
        1. **Install Salesforce CLI**:
           - **Mac**: `brew install salesforce-cli` or download from [Salesforce CLI releases](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/salesforcecli)
           - **Windows**: Download the installer from [Salesforce CLI releases](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/salesforcecli)
           - **Linux**: Use npm: `npm install -g @salesforce/cli` or download from [Salesforce CLI releases](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/salesforcecli)
        
        2. **Verify installation**:
           ```bash
           sf --version
           ```
        
        3. **Login to your Developer Hub account**:
           ```bash
           sf org login web --set-default-dev-hub --alias my-dev-hub
           ```
           This will open a browser window where you can log in to your **Developer Hub account** (the first account you created).
        
        4. **Verify login and see connected organizations**:
           ```bash
           sf org list
           ```
           You should see your Dev Hub organization listed with a "(D)" indicating it's set as the default Dev Hub.
        
        5. **Create a Salesforce project**:
           ```bash
           sf project generate --name nango
           cd nango
           ```
           This creates a new Salesforce project directory structure that we'll use for packaging.
        6. **Open the project in your IDE**:
           Open the `nango` project folder in your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code):
           ```bash
           code .
           ```
        7. **Create package.xml file**:
           In the project root directory, create a `package.xml` file with the following configuration:
           ```xml
           <Package xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata">
               <types>
                   <members>*</members>
                   <name>ExternalClientApplication</name>
               </types>
               <types>
                   <members>*</members>
                   <name>ExtlClntAppOauthSettings</name>
               </types>
               <types>
                <members>*</members>
                <name>ExtlClntAppOauthConfigurablePolicies</name>
              </types>
               <version>58.0</version>
           </Package>
           ```
           This package.xml defines the metadata types we'll be working with for External Client Apps and their OAuth settings.
        
        8. **Retrieve the External Client App from Dev Hub**:
           Now retrieve the External Client App you created in the Dev Hub account using the following command:
           ```bash
           sf project retrieve start --manifest package.xml --target-org johndoe@example.com
           ```
           Replace `johndoe@example.com` with the username of your authenticated Dev Hub account. This command retrieves the External Client App metadata and OAuth settings into your local project. This will add 3 folders **(externalClientApps, extlClntAppOauthSettings and extlClntAppOauthConfigurablePolicies)** in your `force-app/main/default/` folder of the project you are working on.
           
           <Note>If you have more external client apps registered, they will also be added. You can remove them by deleting the specific files inside those folders to remain with the packaged one we created earlier.</Note>
        
        9. **Configure sfdx-project.json and create package version**:
           First, get the package ID by running:
           ```bash
           sf package list --target-dev-hub my-dev-hub
           ```
           
           Open the `sfdx-project.json` file in the root of your project and configure it like this:
           ```json
           {
             "packageDirectories": [
               {
                 "versionName": "ver 0.1", // this is the version number
                 "versionNumber": "0.1.0.NEXT", // auto-incrementing version format
                 "path": "force-app",
                 "default": true,
                 "package": "Nango External App", // package name reference
                 "versionDescription": "" // optional description for this version
               }
             ],
             "name": "my-app", // project name
             "namespace": "<YOUR_NAMESPACE>", // your registered namespace
             "sfdcLoginUrl": "https://login.salesforce.com",
             "sourceApiVersion": "64.0",
             "packageAliases": {
               "Nango External App": "<PACKAGE_ID>" // maps package name to package ID
             }
           }
           ```
           Replace `<PACKAGE_ID>` with the ID obtained from the previous command and `<YOUR_NAMESPACE>` with the namespace you linked to your Dev Hub account.
           
           Then create a package version:
           ```bash
           sf package version create --package <PACKAGE_ID> --installation-key "" --wait 20 --code-coverage --target-dev-hub my-dev-hub
           ```
           You can leave `--installation-key ""` empty to make the package installation open, or provide a key that users will need to enter during installation.
           
           After successfully creating the package, you will get a successful message with an installation URL that you can use to distribute your External Client App to other Salesforce organizations.
        
        10. **Install the package to target organization**:
            Use the installation URL above to install your package to the target Salesforce organization where you want to use the External Client App. 
      </Step>
     </Steps>

  ## Already using a Connected App? Migrate to External Client App
  
  If you previously created a **Connected App**, you can migrate it to an **External Client App**.

  1. Click on the **Setup** menu, then search for and select **App Manager** and open your connected app you would wish to migrate.
  2. If eligible, click the **Migrate to External Client App** button.
  3. Confirm that the app is local and doesn't use the username-password flow.
  4. Click **Migrate**.
  5. A new External Client App will be created, and the old Connected App will remain in read-only mode.
  
  <Note>All changes must be made in the new external client app. Deleting the external client app reactivates the original connected app, but with its previous settings intact.</Note>

  ## Next Steps
  
  After completing either of the above, follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to start using your Salesforce integration.

    -   **External Client Apps vs Connected Apps**: Salesforce has transitioned from Connected Apps to External Client Apps. You must choose the Distribution State (Local vs Packaged) upfront. If distributing to other organizations, you need separate accounts for Dev Hub and namespace registration, and must follow the packaging process outlined in the Oauth Setup guide.
    -   If you or your end-user are authorizing a Salesforce sandbox account, you must use the `salesforce-sandbox` integration in Nango. Your Salesforce Developer Edition account is **not** a Salesforce sandbox! Use it with the regular `salesforce` connector.
    -   Salesforce calls the `client_id` and `client_secret` as `Consumer Key` and `Consumer Secret`.
    -   To enable offline data access with a refresh token, add the `refresh_token` (or its synonym, `offline_access`) scope. By default, access tokens expire in ~2h (but customers can configure this value). Also, check the "Introspect All Tokens" checkbox in your OAuth app settings on the Salesforce developer portal (Salesforce doesn't share the expiration date of access tokens. Instead, Nango needs to call the Salesforce API to check if access tokens are valid.)
    -   If you encounter an error in your flow that says `invalid_client_id`, [make sure your (developer) User's password does not contain any special characters](https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=906F00000009ABLIA2) (yes, really.)
