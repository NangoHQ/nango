## API gotchas
-   You can find permissions required for each API call in their corresponding API methods section, i.e, to retrieve a list of notebook objects from Onenote, you can have a look at [List Notebooks permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/onenote-list-notebooks?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http#permissions).
