# Overview

To authenticate with Malwarebytes, you need:
1. **Account Id** - This is a unique Id assigned to your Nebula account.
2. **Client ID** - A unique identifier for your client.
3. **Client Secret** - A confidential key used to authenticate the identity of the application (client).


This guide will walk you through obtaining these credentials and the account Id within Malwarebytes.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an account with Nebula.
- You must be a Super Admin to create the credentials in Nebula.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding your Account Id
1. Log in to [Nebula](https://cloud.malwarebytes.com/auth/login).
2. Once you're logged in, look at the **URL** in your browser. You should see a string of characters after `.com` in the URL. That string of characters is your **AccountID**.

#### Step 2: Finding your API client credentials
1. Log in to [Nebula](https://cloud.malwarebytes.com/auth/login).
2. In the left navigation pane, click **Integrate**.
3. Click the **Add**.
4. In the **Create Client** pop-up window, enter an Application name.
5. Check **read, write, and/or execute**.
6. Click **Save**.

-   Once this is done, your client credentials are generated. This is the only time your client secret is displayed. If you lose the secret, you need to generate a new secret, and you will be required to update all integrations that used the old secret.

#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have both the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Malwarebytes.
2. Enter the **Account Id**, **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in their respective fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
