# Overview

To authenticate with Aircall (Basic Auth), you need two key pieces of information:
1. **API ID** - A unique identifier for your application on Aircall.
2. **API Token** - A key that grants full access to all your application and configurations.

This guide will walk you through finding or creating those credentials within Aircall.


### Prerequisites:

- You must set up an account with Aircall.
- You should have an associated Aircall number.

#### Step 1: Finding Your Admin API Key (API Token) and Application ID (API ID)
