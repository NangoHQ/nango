## Setup guide

Gong offers two authentication methods: Basic Auth (API Key) and OAuth. Nango supports both methods.

### Basic Auth Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Gong account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Gong account](https://www.gong.io/free-trial/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain API credentials">
    1. Log in to your Gong account.
    2. Navigate to **Company Settings** > **Ecosystem** > **API**.
    3. Click **Get API Key** to generate your API credentials.
    4. You will receive two values:
       - **Access Key**: This is your username in Nango
       - **Access Key Secret**: This is your password in Nango
    5. Make a copy of these credentials as they will be needed when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API gotchas

- End users can generate API keys [on the Gong API page](https://app.gong.io/company/api). They must have the "technical administrator" user role to do this.
- Gong uses BASIC auth for their API, but doesn't call them username and password: `Access Key` is the username in Nango and `Access Key Secret` is the password in Nango.
- [Gong rate-limits](https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#overview) are per second and a total of 10k requests a day.
- By default Gong limits your company's access to the service to 3 API calls per second, and 10,000 API calls per day. You may however change these rates by contacting [help](https://help.gong.io/).
- For OAuth integration, Gong uses `api_base_url_for_customer`, which varies for each customer, as its `base_url` for proxy requests. This parameter is returned in the response of `generate-customer-token`.
