## API gotchas

- Paylocity uses **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow** (`client_id` & `client_secret`).
- Access tokens are **short-lived** and expire **every 1 hour**.
- Tokens must be **refreshed before expiry** to avoid `401 Unauthorized` errors.
- **Secret Rotation:** Paylocity requires API secrets to be **rotated every 365 days**.
- Paylocity APIs **do not require OAuth scopes**—they are managed internally.
