# Overview

To authenticate with Dropbox Sign OAuth, you need:
1. **Client ID** - A unique identifier for your application.
2. **Client Secret** - A confidential key used to authenticate the identity of the application.

This guide will walk you through creating an app and obtaining these credentials within Dropbox Sign.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a Dropbox Sign account.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Creating an App
1. Log in to your [Dropbox Sign Developer Portal](https://app.hellosign.com).
2. Click on the profile icon in the top right corner and select **Settings**.
3. Click on the **API** tab.
4. Scroll down and click on the **Create an App** button.
5. Enable **OAuth** and fill in the required information:
   - **App Name**: Your application's name
   - **OAuth Callback**: Add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` or your own callback URL from your Nango dashboard
   - **Scopes**: Select the actions your app needs to perform
4. Click **Create App** to generate your credentials.

#### Step 2: Obtaining Credentials
1. After creating your app, you'll be provided with:
   - **Client ID**
   - **Client Secret**
2. Make a copy of these credentials, as they will be needed when configuring your integration in Nango. The **Client Secret** will not be shown again, so ensure you store it securely.

#### Step 3: App Approval
1. Before your app can be used in production, it needs to be approved by Dropbox Sign.
2. You can test your app by authorizing it from your own account while building.
3. When ready for production, follow the [App Approval Process](https://developers.hellosign.com/docs/app-approval/overview/).

#### Step 4: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Dropbox Sign OAuth.
2. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in their designated fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
