    2. Add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` as a redirect URI.
    3. Save your changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure integration scopes">
    1. In your integration settings, navigate to the **Scopes** section.
    2. Select the appropriate scopes for your integration needs:
       - **Object configuration**: For access to object configuration data
       - **Record read**: For read access to records
       - **Record write**: For write access to records
       - **List read**: For read access to lists
       - **List write**: For write access to lists
    3. Save your scope configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain your OAuth credentials">
    1. In your integration settings page, locate the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
    2. Copy these values as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
    
    Note: Keep your Client Secret secure and never expose it in client-side code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your integration in Nango">
    When setting up your Attio integration in Nango:
    
    - Use your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the previous step
    - For the authorization URL, use: `https://app.attio.com/authorize`
    - For the token URL, use: `https://app.attio.com/oauth/token`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the OAuth flow">
    1. After configuring your integration in Nango, test the OAuth flow to ensure it works correctly.
    2. The authorization flow will redirect users to Attio where they can approve access to their workspace.
    3. After approval, users will be redirected back to your application with an authorization code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
