# Overview

To authenticate with IT Glue, you need:
1. **API Key** - A key that grants Nango permission to interact with IT Glue's API resources and services.
2. **Subdomain** - Your IT Glue subdomain (api, api.eu, or api.au).

This guide will walk you through obtaining these credentials within IT Glue.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a paid IT Glue subscription with API access.
- You must have administrator privileges to generate API keys.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding Your Subdomain

1. Log in to your IT Glue account.
2. Determine your subdomain based on your login URL:
   - **Global**: `app.itglue.com` → Use subdomain: `api`
   - **EU**: `app.eu.itglue.com` → Use subdomain: `api.eu`  
   - **Australia**: `app.au.itglue.com` → Use subdomain: `api.au`

#### Step 2: Generating Your API Key

1. Navigate to **Account** → **Settings** → **API Keys**.
2. Click **Generate API Key**.
3. Enter a **Name** for your API key (e.g., "Nango Integration").
4. Click **Generate** to create the key.
5. Copy the generated API key immediately (it will only be shown once).

<Note>API keys do not expire but can be revoked if needed. Keep your API key secure and do not share it.</Note>

#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **API Key** and **Subdomain**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with IT Glue.
2. Enter your **Subdomain** (e.g., `api` for Global, `api.eu` for EU, `api.au` for Australia).
3. Enter your **API Key** in its respective field.
4. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
