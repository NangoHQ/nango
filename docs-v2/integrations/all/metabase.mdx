## API gotchas

- Metabase uses API_KEY authentication mode with `x-api-key: API_KEY` as a request header to access different endpoints.
- When creating a new connection on Nango, you will have to provide your domain. If your Metabase is at `https://your-metabase.com` you could access the APIs at `https://your-metabase.com/api/database`.
