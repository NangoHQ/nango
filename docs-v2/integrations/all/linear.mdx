## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Linear account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Linear account](https://linear.app/signup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an OAuth2 application">
    1. Log in to your Linear account.
    2. Under your specific workspace, navigate to **Settings** > **API** > **OAuth applications**.
    3. Click + sign.
    4. It is highly recommended to create a dedicated workspace for managing your OAuth application, as each admin user will have access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth application">
    1. Fill in the required information:
       - **Name**: Your application's name
       - **Developer name**: Your name or company name
       - **Developer URL**: Your website URL
       - **Description** (optional): Your application's description
       - **Callback URLs**: Add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
       - **Icon** (optional): Upload an icon for your application
       - If you want your application to be installed by other workspace, you can toggle the **Public** toggle button.
    2. Click **Create** to save your application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain OAuth credentials">
    1. After creating your application, you'll be provided with:
       - **Client ID**
       - **Client Secret**
    2. Make a copy of these credentials as they will be needed when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API gotchas

- Linear uses a GraphQL API rather than a REST API. This means all API requests are made to a single endpoint (`https://api.linear.app/graphql`).
- Linear has different rate limits depending on the authentication method used. For full details, refer to the [Linear rate limit documentation](https://linear.app/developers/rate-limiting#api-request-limits).
- OAuth tokens do not expire in the short term, but they are valid for up to 10 years. After that, users will need to reauthenticate.
- When creating an OAuth application, it's recommended to create a dedicated workspace for managing the application.
- Linear's GraphQL API requires that you specify exactly which fields you want to retrieve in your queries.
- Linear supports webhooks for real-time updates, which can be more [efficient](https://linear.app/developers/rate-limiting#avoid-polling) than polling for changes.
- The `admin` scope should only be requested if absolutely necessary, as it provides full access to admin-level endpoints.
