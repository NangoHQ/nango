## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Linear account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Linear account](https://linear.app/signup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an OAuth2 application">
    1. Log in to your Linear account.
    2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API** > **OAuth applications**.
    3. Click **New OAuth application**.
    4. It is highly recommended to create a dedicated workspace for managing your OAuth application, as each admin user will have access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth application">
    1. Fill in the required information:
       - **Name**: Your application's name
       - **Developer name**: Your name or company name
       - **Developer URL**: Your website URL
       - **Callback URLs**: Add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
       - **Icon** (optional): Upload an icon for your application
    2. Click **Create** to save your application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain OAuth credentials">
    1. After creating your application, you'll be provided with:
       - **Client ID**
       - **Client Secret**
    2. Make a copy of these credentials as they will be needed when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OAuth scopes">
    When setting up your integration in Nango, you'll need to specify the scopes your application requires. Linear supports the following scopes:
    - `read` - (Default) Read access for the user's account
    - `write` - Write access for the user's account
    - `issues:create` - Allows creating new issues and their attachments
    - `comments:create` - Allows creating new issue comments
    - `timeSchedule:write` - Allows creating and modifying time schedules
    - `admin` - Full access to admin level endpoints (only request if absolutely necessary)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connection configuration in Nango

Linear uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. You can configure your connection in Nango using the standard authorization flow:

```js
nango.auth('linear', '<CONNECTION-ID>');
```

When configuring your integration in Nango, you can specify the scopes your application requires. By default, Linear provides the `read` scope, but you can request additional scopes as needed.

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui).

## API gotchas

- Linear uses a GraphQL API rather than a REST API. This means all API requests are made to a single endpoint (`https://api.linear.app/graphql`).
- Linear has [rate limits](https://developers.linear.app/docs/graphql/working-with-the-graphql-api#rate-limiting) of 200 requests per minute per user token.
- OAuth tokens do not expire, so there's no need for refresh tokens.
- When creating an OAuth application, it's recommended to create a dedicated workspace for managing the application.
- Linear's GraphQL API requires that you specify exactly which fields you want to retrieve in your queries.
- Linear supports webhooks for real-time updates, which can be more efficient than polling for changes.
- The `admin` scope should only be requested if absolutely necessary, as it provides full access to admin-level endpoints.
