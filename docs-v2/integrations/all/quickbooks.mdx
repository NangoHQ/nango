## API gotchas

- Quickbooks requires a company ID for each API request. Quickbooks returns it as part of the OAuth flow, and Nango stores it automatically in the `connection_config` for you with the key `realmId`.
    - You can use [getConnection](/reference/scripts#get-the-connection-credentials) in your integration scripts to retrieve it, or when you fetch the Connection credentials with the REST API or SDK
