## API gotchas

- The Hypergrowth plan is required for full API access
- Free accounts start with 100 API tokens for testing
- Instantly has two API versions:
  - v2 (current) - Recommended for new integrations
    - Uses Bearer token authentication
    - Supports multiple API keys with granular scopes
    - Follows REST API standards
    - No compatibility with v1
  - v1 (deprecated 2025, maintained for a while)
- Rate limit: 10 requests per second for both API versions
- API keys can only be viewed once during creation
- Multiple API keys can be created with different scopes for enhanced security
