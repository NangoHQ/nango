## API gotchas

<ZohoSharedGotchas />

### Bigin-specific gotchas
- You can make your OAuth app cross-data-centers with [these instructions](https://www.bigin.com/developer/docs/apis/multi-dc.html). This means that a single OAuth app will be able to query the Zoho API for Zoho accounts from the US, EU, etc.
- Bigin API has a rate limit of 10,000 API requests per day per organization.
