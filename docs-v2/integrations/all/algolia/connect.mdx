# Overview

To authenticate with Algolia, you need two key pieces of information:
1. **Application ID** – A unique identifier for your application on Algolia.
2. **Admin API Key** – A key that grants full access to all your application's indices and configurations.

This guide will walk you through finding or creating those credentials within Algolia.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding Your Application ID
1. **Log in** to your Algolia dashboard.
2. Select your application in the select location in the header
3. Go to the **Settings > Team > API Keys** section (located in the left-hand menu).

<Tip>You can use your Search-Only API Key if you only want to replicate records, but it won't let index anything to Algolia. You can also choose to generate a dedicated key.</Tip>

#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have both the **Application ID** and **Admin API Key**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Algolia.
2. Enter the **Application ID** in the designated field.
3. Enter the **Admin API Key** in the API Key field for the key.
4. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
