## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Notion account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Notion account](https://www.notion.so/signup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new integration">
    1. Go to [My Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) in your Notion account.
    2. Click **+ New integration**.
    3. Select the workspace where you want to create the integration.
    4. Fill in the basic information:
       - **Name**: Your integration's name
       - **Logo** (optional): Upload an image for your integration
    5. Click **Submit** to create the integration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure integration settings">
    1. In your newly created integration's page, navigate to the **Basic Information** tab.
    2. Fill in the required fields:
       - **Associated workspace**: This should be pre-selected
       - **Company name**: Your company name
       - **Website URL**: Your company website
       - **Redirect URIs**: Add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
    3. Under **Capabilities**, select the appropriate capabilities your integration needs.
    4. Click **Save changes**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your integration public">
    1. By default, your integration is set to "Internal" and can only be used within your workspace.
    2. To enable OAuth for external users, you need to make it public:
       - In the **Distribution** tab, select **Public**.
       - Fill in all required fields including company information and privacy policy URL.
       - Submit your integration for review.
    3. Once approved, your integration will be public and you'll be able to access the OAuth credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain API credentials">
    1. After your integration is made public, go to the **Basic Information** tab.
    2. Under **OAuth Domain & URIs**, you'll find your:
       - **OAuth Client ID**
       - **OAuth Client Secret**
       - **Authorization URL**
    3. You will need these credentials when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">

</Steps>

## API gotchas

- The Notion OAuth API doesn't support refreshing tokens, and so doesn't return a refresh token. The access token never expires.
- Your Notion OAuth app will have the status "internal" by default. You need to [make it "public"](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#how-to-make-an-integration-public) to be able to initiate an OAuth flow with external users. Only then will you be able to get the OAuth client ID/secret and register your callback URL.
- No OAuth scope is required by default for Notion integrations.
- After authorization, users need to explicitly share specific pages or databases with your integration before you can access them.
- Notion has [rate limits](https://developers.notion.com/reference/errors#rate-limiting) that vary by endpoint.
- Notion SCIM is an enterprise-only API that uses an API token. See the Notion [docs](https://www.notion.so/help/provision-users-and-groups-with-scim) for more information.
