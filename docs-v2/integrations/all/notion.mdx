## API gotchas

- The Notion OAuth API doesn't support refreshing tokens, and so doesn't return a refresh token. The access token never expires.
- When creating a Notion OAuth app, it is set to **Internal** by default. You need to make it **Public** to initiate an OAuth flow with users. Only then will you be able to obtain the OAuth client ID/secret and register your callback URL.
- No OAuth scope is required by default for Notion integrations.
- After authorization, users need to explicitly share specific pages or databases with your integration before you can access them.
- Notion has [rate limits](https://developers.notion.com/reference/request-limits#rate-limits) that vary by endpoint.
