**Note**
- Want to integrate with existing Stripe accounts? Use the [Stripe App](/integrations/all/stripe-app) instead.
- Stripe Connect is intended for use with [Stripe’s Connect product](https://stripe.com/connect) and **does not** provide access to existing Stripe accounts via the REST API.
- ⚠️ OAuth for Express accounts is deprecated and not supported for new Connect platforms. Use the [Accounts API with Express onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts) instead. Contact [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/) if you need access for an existing platform.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Express Accounts">
    1. Go to your [Platform settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings).
    2. Enable onboarding Express accounts with OAuth in the OAuth settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure OAuth for Express">
    Navigate to [Connect OAuth settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/onboarding-options/oauth):
    - Add your **Redirect URI(s)**:

  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your Client Secret">
    Navigate to the [Stripe API Keys page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) to retrieve your **Secret key**. This acts as your **Client Secret** for the integration.
