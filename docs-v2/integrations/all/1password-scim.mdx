## API gotchas

- 1Password SCIM uses API_KEY authentication with `Authorization: Bearer API_KEY` in the request header.
- SCIM-based provisioning can take time to sync across all users. Ensure you handle pagination properly when fetching user lists.
- 1Password SCIM requires an active **SCIM Bridge** deployment to function correctly.
