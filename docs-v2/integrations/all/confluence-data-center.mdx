## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up Confluence Data Center">
    1. Ensure you have a running Confluence Data Center instance. If not, you can:
       - [Checkout the Free trial](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download/data-center)
       - [Install Confluence Data Center](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/installing-confluence-data-center-203603.html)
    2. Make sure you have administrator privileges on your Confluence Data Center instance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an incoming link">
    1. Log in to your **Confluence Data Center** instance as an administrator.
    2. Navigate to **Administration** menu > **General Configuration** > **Application links**.
    3. Select **Create link**.
    4. Select **External application** and then choose **Incoming** as the direction.
    5. Fill in the details as described in the sections below.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide application details">
    In the application details section:

    1. Enter a descriptive name for your application.
    2. For the **Redirect URL**, enter `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.

    Note: This is the URL where users will be redirected after authorizing your application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure application permissions">
    Select the appropriate permission scopes for your integration:

    - **READ**: View projects and issues the user can view, including related items like dashboards, filters, attachments, or comments.
    - **WRITE**: Create, update, and delete projects and issues the user can change, including related items.
    - **ADMIN**: Perform most administrative functions on the entire Confluence instance.
    - **SYSTEM_ADMIN**: Perform all administrative functions on the entire Confluence instance.

    Note: Choose only the scopes your application needs. Higher-level scopes automatically include lower-level ones (e.g., WRITE includes READ).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain OAuth credentials">
    1. After creating the incoming link, you'll receive your OAuth credentials:
       - **Client ID**: The identifier for your application
       - **Client Secret**: The secret key for your application
    2. Store these credentials securely as you'll need them to configure your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API gotchas

- Confluence Data Center may be installed with a context path (e.g., `/confluence`) or without one. This affects your API endpoints within Nango. With context: `/confluence/rest/api/...`, or Without context: `/rest/api/...`. Make sure your integration uses the correct one depending on how your Confluence instance is deployed.
