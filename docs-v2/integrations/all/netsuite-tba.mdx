## Connection configuration in Nango

Netsuite requires a user specific account id to run OAuth.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('netsuite', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {accountId: '<netsuite-account-id>'}});
```

For more details see the [docs here](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

- There doesn't seem to be a way to create a Netsuite account without scheduling a call.
- The `netsuite` integration which uses OAuth 2.0 has a refresh token that has a fixed expiration of 7 days. After which point the refresh token becomes invalid and a new access token must be obtained by making users go through the authorization code flow again.
To avoid this we recommend using the machine to machine flow which is called the `netsuite-tba` integration in Nango

## Admin Setup for `netsuite-tba`
-   Ensure you have admin privileges and login to your Netsuite account and navigate to **Setup** > **Company** > **Enable Features**
-   Under the "**SuiteTalk**" header make sure the _SOAP WEB SERVICES_ and _REST WEB SERVICES_ checkboxes are checked
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/netsuite-soap-rest-checkboxes.png" />
</Frame>
-   Under the "**Manage Authentication**" header make sure the _TOKEN-BASED AUTHENTICATION_ checkbox is checked
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/netsuite-tba-checkbox.png" />
</Frame>
-   Click the save button
-   Navigate to **Setup** > **Integration** > **Manage Integrations** > **New**
-   Set the desired name of this integration
-   Enable _TOKEN-BASED AUTHENTICATION_ and disable _TBA: AUTHORIZATION FLOW_ and _AUTHORIZATION CODE GRANT_
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/netsuite-tba-configuration.png" />
</Frame>
-   Click the save button
-   The client credentials will now be displayed and be sure to copy the **Consumer Key**, **Client ID**, **Consumer Secret**, and **Client Secret**
-   Navigate to the homepage by clicking the home icon
-   At the button left corner click the **Manage Access Tokens** button
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/netsuite-create-token.png" />
</Frame>
-   Select the **Application Name** you created for this integration
-   Enter a "**Token Name**"
-   Save your new access token
-   The token credentials will now be displayed. Copy the "**Token ID**" & "**Token Secret**"
-   In Nango create a new integration using the `netsuite-tba` and leave the "Client Id" and "Client Secret" values empty.
-   Create a new connection and for the "**OAuth Client Id Override**" value paste in the
value you received from Netsuite called "**Client ID**" and for the "**OAuth Client Secret**" value paste in the value you received
from Netsuite called "**Client Secret**". For "**Token ID**" & "**Token Secret**" paste in the values you received from Netsuite
from the access token step. The account ID value can be found from your [Netsuite URL instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_1498754928.html)
-   If done programmatically using the Nango frontend sdk:
```js
nango.auth('netsuite-tba', connectionId, {
  params: { accountId: ACCOUNT_ID },
  credentials: {
    token_id: TOKEN_ID,
    token_secret: TOKEN_SECRET,
    oauth_client_id_override: CLIENT_ID,
    oauth_client_secret_override: CLIENT_SECRET,
  }
})
```

## Non-Admin Role Setup for `netsuite-tba`

When setting up Netsuite TBA with a non-admin role, additional configuration is required. This section covers the necessary permissions and setup steps for non-administrator users.

### Required Role Permissions

The role must have the following permissions enabled under **Setup** > **Users/Roles** > **Manage Roles** > **[Your Role]** > **Permissions**:

Under "Setup":
- _SOAP Web Services_ permission
- _REST Web Services_ permission
- _Token-Based Authentication_ permission
- _OAuth 2.0_ permission (recommended for future flexibility)

### Creating Access Tokens with Specific Roles

To create an access token for a non-admin role:

1. Switch to the desired role using the role selector in the top-right corner
2. Navigate to **Setup** > **Integration** > **Manage Access Tokens**
3. Click "New Access Token"
4. Select your application from the dropdown
5. Provide a token name
6. Save and securely store the Token ID and Token Secret that are displayed

<Note>
The role selection at token creation time determines the permissions available to that token. Make sure you're using the correct role before creating the token.
</Note>

### Required Permissions for Token Management

Users who will be creating integrations and tokens need these additional permissions:

Under "Setup":
- _Access Token Management_ permission
- _Integration Application_ permission
- _Manage Integration_ permission

### Additional Configuration Considerations

#### Concurrent Web Services User

If you need to make concurrent API calls:

1. Navigate to **Setup** > **Company** > **Enable Features** > **SuiteCloud** tab
2. Enable "CONCURRENT USERS FOR WEB SERVICES"
3. For each user that needs this capability:
   - Go to **Setup** > **Users/Roles** > **Manage Users**
   - Edit the user
   - Check "Web Services User"
   - Check "Concurrent Web Services User"

<Warning>
The "Concurrent Web Services User" setting may require an additional user license. Consult your Netsuite account representative for details.
</Warning>

### Troubleshooting Non-Admin Access

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. **Permission Verification**:
   - Log out and log back in after permission changes
   - Verify permissions are saved by checking the role again
   - Ensure all parent permissions are also enabled (some permissions have dependencies)

2. **Role Configuration**:
   - Confirm the user is assigned the correct role
   - Verify the role has all required permissions listed above
   - Check if the role has access to the necessary records and features

<Tip>
For detailed permission setup, refer to the [Netsuite Token-Based Authentication Setup Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_157771239605.html).
