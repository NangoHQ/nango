## API gotchas

<ZohoSharedGotchas />

### Books-specific gotchas
- The Zoho Books API has region-specific endpoints. You need to use the correct endpoint based on the user's region.
- You can make your OAuth app cross-data-centers with [these instructions](https://www.zoho.com/books/api/v3/introduction/#multidc). This means that a single OAuth app will be able to query the Zoho API for Zoho accounts from the US, EU, etc.
