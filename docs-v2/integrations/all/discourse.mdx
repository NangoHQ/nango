## API gotchas

- Discourse uses API_KEY authentication mode with `Api-Key: apiKey` and `Api-Username: API Username` in the request header to access different endpoints. Both keys can be obtained from the admin panel.
- Since Nango automatically sets the `Accept: application/json` header, there is no need to include the `.json` suffix in API endpoint URLs. For example, instead of sending a request to `/categories.json`, you can send it to `/categories`, and the JSON response will still be returned.
