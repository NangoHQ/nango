## Useful links
Brex offers both Basic auth `API key` and OAuth as authentication and Nango implements both. To register an OAuth app, you wil need to register as a brex developer partner. If you are a Brex client–i.e., you have your own Brex account, you can use Basic auth `API key`.

## API gotchas

-   Include the scope `offline_access` to get a refresh token (access tokens expire after 1h).
-   Refresh tokens expire after 90 days of non use. Make sure you regularly make an API request as long as you need the connection.
-   Brex offers a staging system to test your apps, you will get access when you register as a partner. Staging details are [here](https://developer.brex.com/docs/partner_authentication/#api-servers)
