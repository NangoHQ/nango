[API docs](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/)

## Connection configuration in Nango

Chargebee requires a user specific subdomain for the API base URL.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('chargebee', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {subdomain: '<chargebee-subdomain>'}});
```
