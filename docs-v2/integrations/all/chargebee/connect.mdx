# Overview

To authenticate with Chargebee, you will need:
1. **API Key** - A key that grants Nango permission to interact with Chargebee's APIs resources and services.
2. **Chargebee Domain** - The unique subdomain for your Chargebee account. It is usually in the form of `https://{your-site-name}.chargebee.com`, where `{your-site-name}` is the unique identifier for your account.


This guide will walk you through generating the API Key within Chargebee. You should also have your Site URL ready, which is the URL shown in your browser when you are logged into your Chargebee account.

## Prerequisites:
- You should have a registered account with Chargebee. Create one on [Chargebee Getting Started page](https://www.chargebee.com/).
- Permission to generate an **API Key**.

#### Step 1: Creating an API key

To authenticate using your API credentials, navigate to the Chargebee authentication form.
Enter your credentials as follows:
