## Connection configuration in Nango

Gorgias requires a user specific subdomain to run OAuth.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('gorgias', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {subdomain: '<gorgias-subdomain>'}});
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

-   To refresh tokens, you will need to set the `offline` as part of the scopes when creating an integration.
