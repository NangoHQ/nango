## API gotchas

-   **API Key Security**: Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories. Always use environment variables or secure storage.
-   **Rate Limits**: Be mindful of API rate limits. Check the [API documentation](https://docs.retellai.com/deploy/concurrency#understand-concurrency-and-limits) for details.
-   **Webhook Security**: Use the designated webhook API key for signing and verifying webhook requests to ensure they are legitimate.
