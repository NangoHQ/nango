## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Zendesk account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Zendesk account](https://www.zendesk.com/register/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an OAuth client">
    1. Log in to your Zendesk account.
    2. Navigate to **Admin Center** > **Apps and Integrations** > **APIs** > **Zendesk API**.
    3. In the **OAuth Clients** tab, click **Add OAuth Client**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth client">
    1. Fill in the required information:
       - **Client Name**: Your application's name
       - **Description**: Brief description of your app
       - **Company**: Your company name
       - **Logo** (optional): Upload a logo for your application
       - **Unique Identifier**: A unique identifier for your app (e.g., your-app-name)
       - **Redirect URLs**: Add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
    2. Click **Save** to create your OAuth client.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain OAuth credentials">
    1. After creating your OAuth client, you'll be provided with:
       - **Unique Identifier** (Client ID)
       - **Secret** (Client Secret)
    2. Make a copy of these credentials, as they will be needed when configuring your integration in Nango. The **Secret** will not be shown again, so ensure you store it securely.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Request a global OAuth client (optional)">
    If your application needs to connect to multiple Zendesk instances, you should request a global OAuth client:
    
    1. Develop your app using a local OAuth client first.
    2. Ensure your Unique Identifier is prefixed with "zdg-" (e.g., "zdg-your-app-name").
    3. Fill out all fields in the local client, even those labeled as "optional".
    4. When your app is ready for multiple Zendesk accounts, follow the [global OAuth client request process](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/marketplace/building-a-marketplace-app/set-up-a-global-oauth-client/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API gotchas

-   Make sure to create a Zendesk OAuth app (`https://<USER-SUBDOMAIN>.zendesk.com/admin/apps-integrations/apis/zendesk-api/settings`), _not_ a Zendesk Sales CRM OAuth app. 
-   Zendesk OAuth apps [must be made "global"](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/marketplace/building-a-marketplace-app/set-up-a-global-oauth-client/) to connect to multiple `<USER-SUBDOMAIN>`s.
-   The subdomain is a critical part of the OAuth flow and API calls. It's the unique identifier in the Zendesk URL: `https://<subdomain>.zendesk.com`.
-   Zendesk has [rate limits](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/introduction/rate-limits/) that vary by plan.
-   OAuth tokens expire after a certain period, but Nango automatically handles token refresh for you.
-   When creating an OAuth client, make sure to fill out all fields, even those marked as "optional", especially if you plan to request a global OAuth client later.
-   For security reasons, Zendesk doesn't allow developers to create their own global OAuth clients. You must request one from Zendesk.
