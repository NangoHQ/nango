## API gotchas
-   Tsheetsteam currently doesn't support scopes.
-   Tsheetsteam enforces a rate limit of 300 calls within any 5 minute time window. Rate limiting is primarily considered on a per-connection basis (per access token). For more details [Tsheetsteam request throttling](https://tsheetsteam.github.io/api_docs/#request-throttling)
