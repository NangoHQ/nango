# Overview

To authenticate with Addepar (Basic Auth), you will need:

1. **Firm ID** – A unique identifier for your Addepar firm, found in the API URL.
2. **Firm Domain** – The subdomain of your Addepar instance (e.g., "myfirm" from myfirm.addepar.com).
3. **API Key** – A unique identifier assigned to your API user.
4. **API Secret** – A secret string paired with the API key, required to authenticate API requests.

This guide will walk you through finding your **Firm ID** and **Firm Domain**, enabling API access for your user, and generating an **API key and API secret** within Addepar.

### Prerequisites

- You must have an Addepar account with **Firm Administrator** permissions.
- Your user must be granted **API Access** permissions.

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Finding Your Firm Domain
1. Log in to your Addepar instance.
2. Look at the URL in your browser's address bar. Your **Firm Domain** is the text before `.addepar.com` and after `https://`.
- For example, if your URL is `https://myfirm.addepar.com`, then your **Firm Domain** is `myfirm`.


#### Step 2: Finding Your Firm ID
1. Open the Analysis Tool in Addepar.
2. Click Export above the table and select **Generate API URL**.
3. Look at the generated URL. Your **Firm ID** is the value of `addepar_firm=` in the query string.
- Example: https://terrabella.addepar.com/api/v1?...addepar_firm=12345 → Firm ID is `12345`.

#### Step 3: Assigning API Permissions to the User

1. Log in to your Addepar tenant account.
2. From the global navigation bar, go to **Firm Administration**.
3. In the left navigation menu, click **Users** under **User Permissions**.
4. Find the user who will own the API key.
5. Open the **Permissions** tab for that user.
6. Scroll down to **API Access** and select **Create, edit, and delete**.

This ensures the user is authorized to generate and use API credentials.

#### Step 4: Generating an API Key and Secret

1. In **Firm Administration**, select **Firm Settings**.
2. In the left navigation menu, click **API Access Key**.
