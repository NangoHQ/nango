## API gotchas

- **HTTP Redirects**: Dayforce issues an HTTP redirect for every request to route it to the appropriate service. For high-volume integrations, you can avoid repeated redirects by making a REST request to `/{companyId}/V1/ClientMetadata`. Use the `companyId` from your connection configuration to retrieve the `ServiceUri`, and make subsequent API calls directly to that URI.
