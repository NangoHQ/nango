# Overview

To authenticate with Azure DevOps, you will need:
1. **Organization URL** - The URL of your Azure DevOps organization
2. **Personal Access Token (PAT)** - A token that grants Nango permission to interact with Azure DevOps APIs resources and services.

This guide will walk you through finding your Organization URL and generating a Personal Access Token within Azure DevOps.

## Prerequisites:
- You should have a registered account with Azure DevOps. Create one on [Azure DevOps Getting Started page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/).
- Permission to generate a **Personal Access Token**.

#### Step 1: Finding your Organization URL
1. Log in to your Azure DevOps account at https://dev.azure.com
2. Your organization URL will be in one of these formats:
   - `https://dev.azure.com/{your-organization}`
   - `https://{your-organization}.visualstudio.com`
3. Note down your organization URL as you'll need it for the connection.

#### Step 2: Creating a Personal Access Token
1. While logged in to Azure DevOps, click on your profile picture in the top right corner
2. Select "Security" from the dropdown menu
3. Navigate to the "Personal access tokens" section
4. Click on "New Token"
5. Fill in the following details:
   - Name: Give your token a descriptive name
   - Organization: Select the organization you want to access
   - Expiration: Choose when the token should expire
   - Scopes: For full access, select "Full access". Otherwise, select at least **"Read"** under "Project and team".
6. Click "Create" to generate the token
7. Copy the generated token immediately and store it securely - you won't be able to see it again

#### Step 3: Connect Your Azure DevOps Account

To authenticate using your credentials, navigate to the Azure DevOps authentication form.
Enter your credentials as follows:
- Organization URL: Your Azure DevOps organization URL (e.g., `dev.azure.com/your-organization` or `your-organization.visualstudio.com`)
- Personal Access Token: Your generated PAT

Click "Connect" to complete the authentication.

Note: Make sure to match the credentials exactly as shown above - the field names in the form may differ from your Azure DevOps dashboard.
