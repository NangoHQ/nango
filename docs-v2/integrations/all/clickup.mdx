## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a ClickUp account">
    1. If you don't already have a ClickUp account, go to [ClickUp's signup page](https://app.clickup.com/signup) and create one.
    2. Sign in to your ClickUp account.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a new OAuth app">
    1. In the upper-right corner, click on your avatar.
    2. Select **Settings** from the dropdown menu.
    3. In the sidebar, click on **Apps**.
    4. Click the **Create new app** button.
    
    Note: Only Workspace owners or admins can create OAuth apps.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth application">
    Fill in the required fields:
    
    1. **App name**: Enter a name for your application.
    2. **Redirect URL**: Enter `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
    
    This is the URL where ClickUp will redirect users after they authorize your application.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Obtain your OAuth credentials">
    After creating your app, you'll receive:
    
    - **Client ID**: A unique identifier for your application
    - **Client Secret**: A secret key for your application
    
    Make sure to store these securely, especially the Client Secret, as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure your integration in Nango">
    When setting up your ClickUp integration in Nango:
    
    - Use your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the previous step
    - For the authorization URL, use: `https://app.clickup.com/api`
    - For the token URL, use: `https://api.clickup.com/api/v2/oauth/token`
    
    Note: ClickUp does not use scopes in their OAuth implementation, so you can leave the scope field empty.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Understand the OAuth flow">
    The ClickUp OAuth flow follows these steps:
    
    1. Users are redirected to ClickUp's authorization page: `https://app.clickup.com/api?client_id={client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}`
    2. Users log in to ClickUp and select which Workspaces to authorize for your app
    3. After authorization, users are redirected back to your redirect URL with an authorization code
    4. Your application exchanges this code for an access token using the token endpoint
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test the OAuth flow">
    1. After configuring your integration in Nango, test the OAuth flow to ensure it works correctly.
    2. The authorization flow will redirect users to ClickUp where they can approve access to their Workspaces.
    3. After approval, users will be redirected back to your application with an authorization code.
    4. This code will be exchanged for an access token that can be used to make API requests.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API gotchas

- ClickUp does not use scopes in their OAuth implementation, so you can leave the scope field empty when configuring your integration.

- Users can authorize one or more Workspaces for your application. Use the [Get Authorized Teams (Workspaces)](https://developer.clickup.com/reference/getauthorizedteams) endpoint to see which Workspaces are authorized.

- If you need to modify Workspace permissions, redirect users back to the authorization URL.
