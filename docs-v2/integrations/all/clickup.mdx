    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _ClickUp_. Nango doesn't provide a test OAuth app for ClickUp yet. You'll need to set up your own by following these [instructions](#🧑%E2%80%8D💻-oauth-app-setup). After that, make sure to add the OAuth client ID and secret in the integration settings in Nango.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize ClickUp">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to ClickUp. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the ClickUp API">
        Let's make your first request to the ClickUp API (fetch the profile of the currently signed-in user). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/api/v2/user" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
                ```

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            const res = await nango.get({
                endpoint: '/api/v2/user',
                providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
                connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
            });

            console.log(JSON.stringify(res.data, null, 2));
            ```
            </Tab>


        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.

    Next step: [Embed the auth flow](/getting-started/quickstart/embed-in-your-app) in your app to let your users connect their ClickUp accounts.

  <Tab title="🧑‍💻 OAuth app setup">
  <Steps>
  <Step title="Create a ClickUp account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [ClickUp account](https://app.clickup.com/signup).

    5. Click **Create App**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Obtain OAuth credentials">
    1. After creating your app, you'll receive a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Make a copy of these as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.

  <Tab title="🚨 API gotchas">
    - ClickUp does not use scopes in their OAuth implementation, so you can leave the scope field empty when configuring your integration in Nango.
    - Users can authorize one or more Workspaces for your application. Use the [Get Authorized Teams (Workspaces)](https://developer.clickup.com/reference/getauthorizedteams) endpoint to see which Workspaces are authorized.
