## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a FreshBooks account">
    1. If you don't already have a FreshBooks account, go to [FreshBooks' signup page](https://www.freshbooks.com/signup) and create one.
    2. Sign in to your FreshBooks account.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access the developer portal">
    1. Go to the [FreshBooks developer page](https://www.freshbooks.com/api/start).
    2. Click on the "sign up" link to access your FreshBooks account.
    3. Navigate to the developer portal by clicking on "the developer page" link.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a new OAuth application">
    1. In the developer portal, click on **Create Application**.
    2. Fill in the required information for your application:
       - **Application Name**: Enter a name for your application.
       - **Application Description**: Provide a brief description of what your application does.
       - **Company Name**: Enter your company name.
       - **Application Website**: Enter the URL of your application's website.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure OAuth settings">
    1. In the OAuth settings section, add the following redirect URI:
       - `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
    
    2. Select the appropriate scopes for your application based on your needs. Common scopes include:
       - `user:profile:read` - Read user profile information
       - `user:clients:read` - Read client information
       - `user:invoices:read` - Read invoice information
       - `user:invoices:write` - Create and update invoices
       - `user:estimates:read` - Read estimate information
       - `user:estimates:write` - Create and update estimates
       - `user:expenses:read` - Read expense information
       - `user:expenses:write` - Create and update expenses
    
    3. Save your application settings.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Obtain your OAuth credentials">
    After creating your application, you'll receive:
    
    - **Client ID**: A unique identifier for your application
    - **Client Secret**: A secret key for your application
    
    Make sure to store these securely, especially the Client Secret, as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure your integration in Nango">
    When setting up your FreshBooks integration in Nango:
    
    - Use your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the previous step
    - For the authorization URL, use: `https://auth.freshbooks.com/oauth/authorize`
    - For the token URL, use: `https://api.freshbooks.com/auth/oauth/token`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Understand the OAuth flow">
    The FreshBooks OAuth flow follows these steps:
    
    1. Users are redirected to FreshBooks' authorization page
    2. Users log in to FreshBooks and approve access for your application
    3. After authorization, users are redirected back to your redirect URL with an authorization code
    4. Your application exchanges this code for an access token using the token endpoint
    5. The access token is used in the `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}` header for all API requests
    6. FreshBooks also provides a refresh token that can be used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test the OAuth flow">
    1. After configuring your integration in Nango, test the OAuth flow to ensure it works correctly.
    2. The authorization flow will redirect users to FreshBooks where they can approve access to their account.
    3. After approval, users will be redirected back to your application with an authorization code.
    4. This code will be exchanged for an access token that can be used to make API requests.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>
