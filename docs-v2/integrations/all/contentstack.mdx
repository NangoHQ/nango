## Connection configuration in Nango

- Contentstack requires a [region specific subdomain extension](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/developer-hub/contentstack-oauth/#construct-your-authorization-url) to run OAuth. The region depends on where your user's data is hosted with Contentstack.

- You also need your app's UID, which you should get from Contentstack after registering.

- You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('contentstack', '<CONNECTION-ID>',
            {
                params: {
                    subdomain: 'app',
                    appId: '<app-uid>'
                }
            });
```

- For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).
- You will also need to add your `apiDomain` when creating a new connection. Please refer to the specific API documentation to determine the correct `apiDomain` to use. For instance, if you are using the `Content Delivery API`, review the [Base URL](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/apis/content-delivery-api#base-url) section in its documentation.
