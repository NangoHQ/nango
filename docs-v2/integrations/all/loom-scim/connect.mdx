# Overview

To connect your **Loom SCIM** account, you need to authenticate using an **API Key** and a **SCIM Bridge URL**. This allows Nango to securely manage user provisioning, deprovisioning, and access control through the Loom SCIM API.

This guide will help you retrieve your SCIM credentials, configure **SSO**, enable **domain capture**, and set up **user deprovisioning**.

---

### Prerequisites

- A **Loom Enterprise** account.
- **SAML SSO enabled** (SCIM cannot be configured without SSO).
- A **SCIM API Key** generated from the **Loom Admin Console**.
- The **SCIM Bridge URL** (e.g., `https://scim.example.com`).

ðŸš¨ **Important**:  
Loom requires **SSO to be enabled** before generating SCIM credentials. Ensure your workspace has been configured accordingly.

---

## Step 1: Verify Your Domain
Before configuring SSO or SCIM, an **Admin must verify the domain**.

1. Log in to the **Loom Admin Console**.
2. Go to **Workspace Settings** â†’ **Security Tab**.
3. Find the **Authorize Domains** section and add your domain.
4. Choose a verification method:
   - **Email Verification** â†’ Sends an email to a specified admin inbox.
   - **DNS TXT Record** â†’ Requires adding a TXT record to your domain's DNS settings.
5. After verifying, your domain will be listed as **authorized**.

ðŸš¨ **Check Existing Users:**  
Ensure no users with **unverified domains** are already invited to your workspace. If they exist, they will be **blocked** from logging into Loom.

---

## Step 2: Configure SSO
Once your domain is verified, follow these steps to enable **Single Sign-On (SSO)**.

1. Log in to **Loom Admin Console**.
2. Go to **Workspace Settings** â†’ **Security Tab** â†’ **SSO & Directory Sync**.
3. Click **Configure SSO** and follow the step-by-step guide.
4. Set the **Default Role** for newly provisioned users.

### Testing SSO Before Enforcing
Loom provides an **Enforce SSO** setting:
- **Toggle OFF** â†’ Users can continue logging in with email/password.
- **Toggle ON** â†’ Users **must** authenticate using SSO.

ðŸš¨ **Important:**  
After enabling SSO, existing users must **log out and log back in** via SSO to be recognized as workspace members.

---

## Step 3: Retrieve Your Loom SCIM API Key

1. Log in to the [Loom Admin Console](https://www.loom.com/admin/security).
2. Navigate to **Security** â†’ **Directory Sync (SCIM)**.
3. Click **Configure Directory Sync**.
4. Copy the **SCIM Endpoint** and **Bearer Token**.
5. Store the API Key securely; it will not be shown again.

---

## Step 4: Get Your SCIM Bridge URL
Your **SCIM Bridge URL** is typically provided in **WorkOS** or Loom's SCIM setup guide. It should follow this format:

https://scim.yourdomain.com

If you're unsure of your SCIM Bridge URL:
- Check with your **IT team** or **Loom administrator**.
- Look in the **Loom SCIM configuration settings**.

---

## Step 5: Enable Domain Capture
Loomâ€™s **Domain Capture** setting ensures that all users with your **verified domain** automatically join your **Enterprise workspace**.

1. Log in to **Loom Admin Console**.
2. Go to **Workspace Settings** â†’ **Security Tab**.
3. Scroll down to **Domain Capture** settings.

There are **two options**:
- **Off (Manual Management)** â†’ New users must be invited or provisioned via SCIM.
- **Capture New Users in My Domain (Recommended)** â†’ All users with your domain **automatically join** your Loom workspace.

ðŸš¨ **Note:**  
If **Directory Sync (SCIM)** is enabled, users are provisioned **immediately** when added to the **Loom app** in your IdP.

---

## Step 6: Connect Your Loom SCIM Account
To authenticate with Loom SCIM, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Loom SCIM integration setup** in Nango.
2. Enter your **SCIM Bridge URL** and **API Key**.
3. Click **Connect** to validate the credentials and establish the connection.
