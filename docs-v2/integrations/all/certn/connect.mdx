# Overview

To authenticate with Certn, you will need:

This guide will walk you through generating the API Key within Certn.


## Prerequisites:
- You should have a registered account with Certn. Create one on [Certn Getting Started page](https://lime.certn.co/welcome/signUp/).
- Permission to generate an **API Key**.

#### Step 1: Creating an API key

1. **Log in** to your Certn dashboard and click on the **Profile** icon on the top right corner of the screen.
