## API gotchas

-   You can find scopes required for each API call in their corresponding API calls section. For example, to retrieve a list of datasets from My workspace, you can refer to the Required scope section of the [Get Datasets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/datasets/get-datasets#required-scope) documentation. You also need to prepend the hostname to the scope, which in the get datasets example would be `https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/Dataset.ReadWrite.All`. For more details, check [this resource out](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Service/Azure-AD-App-Authentication-scope-doesn-t-exist-on-app-with/m-p/3074525/highlight/true#M188140).
-   Please be aware that the Microsoft Power Bi implements throttling to manage the volume of requests. For more information on handling throttling, refer to the [Microsoft Power Bi Throttling Guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/#throttling).
