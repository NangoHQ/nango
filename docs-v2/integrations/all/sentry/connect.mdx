# Overview

To authenticate with Sentry, you will need:
1. **Hostname** - The Hostname to your Sentry account.
2. **Auth Token** - A key that grants Nango permission to interact with Sentry's APIs resources and services.

This guide will walk you through finding your **Hostname** and generating your **Auth Token** within Sentry.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a Sentry account.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding Your Hostname
Sentry APIs use different hostname based on your region:
- Default hostname: `sentry.io`
- US region: `us.sentry.io`
- EU region: `eu.sentry.io`

#### Step 2: Generating Your Sentry Auth Token
1. Login to your [Sentry account](https://sentry.io/auth/login/).
2. Go to **Settings** > **Auth Tokens** (or visit [auth tokens](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/)).
3. Click **Create New Token**.

6. Click **Create Token**.
7. Copy your token immediately - it won't be shown again


#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your credentials:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Sentry.
2. Enter the **Hostname** and **Auth Token** in their designated fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
