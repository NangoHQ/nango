# Overview

To authenticate with Sentry, you will need:
1. **Auth Token** - A key that grants Nango permission to interact with Sentry's APIs resources and services.

This guide will walk you through generating your **Auth Token** within Sentry.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a Sentry account.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding Your API Domain
Sentry APIs use different domains based on your region:
- Default domain: `sentry.io`
- US region: `us.sentry.io`
- EU region: `eu.sentry.io`

#### Step 2: Generating Your Sentry Auth Token
1. Login to your [Sentry account](https://sentry.io/auth/login/)
2. Go to Settings > Auth Tokens (or visit [sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/))
3. Click "Create New Token"

5. Select the required scopes

6. Click "Create Token"
7. Copy your token immediately - it won't be shown again


You can now use this token to connect Nango to your Sentry account.

Store your Auth Token securely. Anyone with access to it can access your Sentry data.
