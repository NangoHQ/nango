# Overview

To authenticate with Avalara (Sandbox), you will need:

2. **Password** - The password linked to your Avalara (Sandbox) AvaTax account, required for secure authentication. Alternatively, you can use your **License Key** instead of a **Password**.
3. **AvalaraClient** - A key that can help you diagnose and resolve issues with your software.

This guide will walk you through finding or generating the **Account ID/License Key** pair within Avalara (Sandbox).
