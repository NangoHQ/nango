# Overview

To authenticate with Workday, you need:
1. **Hostname** - The base URL for the Workday Web Services endpoint.
2. **Tenant** - The unique identifier for your Workday instance, often included in the URL.
3. **Username** - The Workday Integration System User (ISU) username.
4. **Password** â€“ The password for the ISU user, used in combination with the ISU username to authenticate API requests to Workday.

This guide will walk you through finding or generating these credentials within Workday.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an account with Workday with administrator access.

#### Step 1: Finding your Hostname
1. Log in to your Workday instance.
2. In your Workday homepage, go to the search bar and type **View API Clients** then select it.
3. Look for the **Workday REST API Endpoint** field.
4. The **Hostname** is everything after `https://` and before `/ccx/api/v1/`.
- Example: If the endpoint is `https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/api/v1/yourtenant_abc`, the hostname is `wd2-impl-services1.workday.com`.
