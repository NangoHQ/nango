  <Tab title="🚀 Quickstart">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Bullhorn_. Nango doesn't provide a test OAuth app for Bullhorn yet. You'll need to set up your own by following these [instructions](#🧑%E2%80%8D💻-oauth-app-setup). After that, make sure to add the OAuth client ID and secret in the integration settings in Nango.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Bullhorn">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then enter your Bullhorn API Username and Password. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Bullhorn API">
        Let's make your first request to the Bullhorn API (check current session expiration date). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/ping" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
                ```

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            const res = await nango.get({
                endpoint: '/ping',
                providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
                connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
            });

            console.log(res.data);
            ```
            </Tab>


        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ✅ You’re connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.

    <Tip>
    Next step: [Embed the auth flow](/getting-started/quickstart/embed-in-your-app) in your app to let your users connect their Bullhorn accounts.

  <Tab title="🧑‍💻 OAuth app setup">
   <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a Bullhorn account">
        If you don't already have a Bullhorn account, you can [request a Live Demo](https://www.bullhorn.com/request-a-demo/#). This is the first step toward setting up a new account with Bullhorn.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Obtain Client Credentials">
        Go to the [Bullhorn Customer Hub](https://help.bullhorn.com/) and create a support ticket to request API access. 

        In your request, specify that you need **OAuth 2.0 API keys** for your integration. For the **Redirect URI**, specify `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Obtain your OAuth credentials">
        Once approved, Bullhorn will provide you with:
        - `Client ID`
        - `Client Secret`
        - `Redirect URI` (the callback URL you provided during registration)

        Save these credentials securely as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
