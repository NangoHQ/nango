# Overview

To authenticate with Amazon Selling Partner (Beta), you need:
1. **Application ID** - The unique identifier for your Amazon Selling Partner (Beta) application.
2. **Subdomain** - The subdomain representing the Amazon platform you are integrating with.
3. **Domain Extension** -  The domain extension specific to the Amazon marketplace you are connecting to.
4. **Proxy BaseUrl Region** - The geographical region associated with the Amazon marketplace.

This guide will walk you through finding or creating these credentials within Amazon Selling Partner (Beta).

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an Amazon Selling Partner account.

<Tip>The beta version is an application still in draft status.</Tip>
#### Step 1: Finding Your App Id
1. Login to your Seller Central account.
2. Go to Developer Console.
3. Once in the Developer Console, find the specific application you're looking for, and the corresponding Application ID will be visible alongside it.


#### Step 2: Finding Your Subdomain
- The subdomain is determined by your application's type (public or private).
- For Public Applications and Private Seller Applications (authorized through Seller Central), use the **sellercentral** subdomain.
- For Private Vendor Applications (authorized through Vendor Central), use the **vendorcentral** subdomain.

#### Step 3: Finding Your Extension
- Different marketplaces have different domain extensions. Please visit this [link](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/amazon-shipping/docs/seller-central-urls) to find the specific domain for your marketplace. For example, based on the table, the Seller Central URL for the `Saudi Arabia` marketplace is `https://sellercentral.amazon.com.sa`, so the domain extension is **com.sa**.

For example, for the North America selling region (including Canada, US, Mexico, and Brazil marketplaces), the endpoint is `https://sellingpartnerapi-na.amazon.com`, and the proxy baseUrl region will be **na**.
