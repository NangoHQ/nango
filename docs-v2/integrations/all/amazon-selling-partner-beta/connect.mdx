This guide will walk you through finding or creating these credentials within Amazon Selling Partner (Beta).

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an Amazon Selling Partner account.

<Tip>The beta version is an application still in draft status.</Tip>
#### Step 1: Finding Your App Id
1. Login to your Seller Central account.
2. Go to Developer Console.
3. Once in the Developer Console, find the specific application you're looking for, and the corresponding Application ID will be visible alongside it.


#### Step 2: Finding Your Domain
- You need to provide the domain for your application, which varies based on your application's type and marketplace.

- For Public Applications & Private Seller Applications (authorized through Seller Central),you should use the Seller Central domain.
- For Private Vendor Applications (authorized through Vendor Central), you should use the Vendor Central domain.
- To find the correct domain for your marketplace, visit this [link](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/amazon-shipping/docs/seller-central-urls).
- For example, based on the table, the Seller Central URL for the Saudi Arabia marketplace is https://sellercentral.amazon.com.sa, so the full domain is `sellercentral.amazon.com.sa`.
