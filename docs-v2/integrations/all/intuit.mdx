## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your app on the Intuit Developer Portal">
    1. Sign up for an [Intuit Developer account](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/homepage) if you don't already have one.
    2. Sign in to your [developer account](https://developer.intuit.com/dashboard).
    3. Click on **Create an app** on the dashboard.
    4. Select **QuickBooks Online and Payments** as the API provider.
    5. Enter your app name and select the appropriate app type:
       - **Development**: For testing and development
       - **Production**: For live applications
    6. Click **Create app**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OAuth 2.0 settings">
    1. In your app's dashboard, navigate to the **Development** or **Production** section (depending on your environment).
    2. Select **Keys & OAuth** from the left navigation menu.
    3. Under **Redirect URIs**, click **Add URI**.
    4. Enter `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` as the redirect URI.
    5. Click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select OAuth scopes">
    1. In the **Keys & OAuth** section, locate the **OAuth 2.0** area.
    2. Under **Select scopes**, choose the appropriate scopes for your integration:
       - **Accounting**: For access to QuickBooks Online accounting data
       - **Payments**: For access to payment processing features
       - **OpenID**: For user authentication (recommended)
       - **Profile**: For access to user profile information
       - **Email**: For access to user email information
       - **Phone**: For access to user phone information
       - **Address**: For access to user address information
    3. Click **Save** to update your scopes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain your client credentials">
    1. In the **Keys & OAuth** section, locate your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
    2. Copy these values as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
    
    Note: There are separate credentials for Development and Production environments. Make sure you're using the correct set for your intended environment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your integration in Nango">
    When setting up your Intuit integration in Nango:
    
    - Use your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the previous step
    - For the authorization URL, use: `https://appcenter.intuit.com/connect/oauth2`
    - For the token URL, use: `https://oauth.platform.intuit.com/oauth2/v1/tokens/bearer`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the authorization flow">
    1. Use the [OAuth Playground](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/playground) to test your OAuth implementation.
    2. The OAuth Playground provides sample data and allows you to preview each step of the authorization flow.
    3. This step is optional but recommended to ensure your OAuth configuration is working correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API gotchas

- Refresh tokens have a rolling expiry of 100 days. If 100 days pass, or your refresh token expires, users need to go through the authorization flow again and reauthorize your app.

- Access tokens are valid for 60 minutes (3,600 seconds). When they expire, use refresh tokens to refresh them without prompting users for permission.

- When making API calls, you must include the `realmId` (company ID) in your requests. This is returned during the OAuth flow and identifies the specific QuickBooks Online company the user has authorized your app to access.

- The `state` parameter is required for security in the OAuth flow to prevent CSRF attacks. It should contain an anti-forgery token that your app can verify when the user is redirected back to your app.

- When refreshing tokens, you must use the most recent refresh token received from the Intuit OAuth 2.0 Server. Each time you refresh an access token, you'll receive a new refresh token that you should store and use for future refreshes.

- For production apps, you must implement proper error handling for cases where refresh tokens expire or are revoked. This typically involves redirecting users through the authorization flow again.

- Intuit's OAuth implementation requires the `Authorization` header with the client credentials encoded in Base64 format when exchanging authorization codes for tokens or refreshing tokens: `Authorization: Basic base64(client_id:client_secret)`.
