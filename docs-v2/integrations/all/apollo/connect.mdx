<Note>To access all endpoints that are available with your Apollo plan, set your key to be a master key by toggling on the **Set as master key** slider. Certain endpoints such as [Get a List of Users](https://docs.apollo.io/docs/get-a-list-of-users) are only accessible when using a master API key.</Note>
#### Step 2: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **API Key**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Apollo.
2. Enter your **API Key** in its respective field.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
