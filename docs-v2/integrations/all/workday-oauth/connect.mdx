# Overview

To authenticate with Workday (OAuth), you need:
1. **Authorization Hostname** -  The hostname used to authorize your Workday account.
2. **Token Hostname** - The hostname used to obtain the token for your Workday account, which also serves as the base URL for REST API requests.
3. **Tenant** - The unique identifier for your Workday instance, often included in the homepage URL.

This guide will walk you through obtaining these connection configuration values within Workday.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an account with Workday with administrative access.

### Instructions:


#### Step 1: Finding your Authorization Hostname
1. Log in to your Workday instance.
2. In your Workday homepage, go to the search bar and type **View API Clients** then select it.
3. Look for the **Authorization Endpoint** field.
4. The **Authorization Hostname** is everything after `https://` and before `yourtenant`.
- Example: If the endpoint is `https://impl.workday.com/yourtenant_abc/authorize`, your **Authorization Hostname** is `impl.workday.com`.

#### Step 2: Finding your Token Hostname
1. In the same page, you can locate your **Token Hostname** within the **Token Endpoint** field.
2. The **Token Hostname** is everything after `https://` and before `ccx`.
- Example: If the endpoint is ` https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/oauth2/yourtenant_abc/token`, your **Token Hostname** is `wd2-impl-services1.workday.com`.

#### Step 3: Finding your Tenant
1. In the same **Token Endpoint** field from the **View API Clients** report, the **Tenant** is the final part of the URL after `/oauth2/` and before `/token`.
- Example: If the endpoint is `https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/oauth2/yourtenant_abc/token`, your **Tenant** is `yourtenant_abc`.


#### Step 4: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Authorization Hostname**, **Token Hostname** and **Tenant**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Workday (OAuth).
2. Enter your **Authorization Hostname**, **Token Hostname** and **Tenant** in their designated fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
