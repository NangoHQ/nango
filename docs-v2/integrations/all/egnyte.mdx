## API gotchas

- Currently Nango supports public [applications](https://developers.egnyte.com/docs/read/Public_API_Authentication#Public-Applications) via [authorization code](https://developers.egnyte.com/docs/read/Public_API_Authentication#auth_code) flow to generate an access token.
- Egnyte [requires a user specific subdomain](https://developers.egnyte.com/docs/read/Public_API_Authentication#Authorization-Code-Flow) to run OAuth.
- Until you application has been approved for production use, it will only work on the subdomain registered in your application key's profile.
