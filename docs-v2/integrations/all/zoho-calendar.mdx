## API gotchas

- For production applications, consider implementing [multi-datacenter support](https://www.zoho.com/accounts/protocol/oauth/multi-dc.html) to handle users from different regions.
- For specific scopes, refer to the API documentation pages to find the exact scopes needed per API and per method.
