## Connection configuration in Nango

Xero uses a multi-tenanted architecture where users can have access to multiple organizations (tenants). When a user authorizes your app, they will be asked to select which Xero organization(s) they want to connect.

Nango automatically handles the tenant selection process during the OAuth flow. The tenant information is stored in the connection and can be accessed in your integration scripts.

```js
nango.auth('xero', '<CONNECTION-ID>');
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui).

## API gotchas

- Xero access tokens expire after 30 minutes, but Nango automatically handles token refresh for you.
- Xero requires the `offline_access` scope to get refresh tokens.
- Xero requires the `openid` scope for all OAuth 2.0 applications.
- When a user authorizes your app, they select which Xero organization(s) to connect. Your app can only access data for the selected organization(s).
- Xero has [rate limits](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/oauth2/limits) that vary by API endpoint and subscription plan.
- If you need to work with multiple Xero organizations, you'll need to handle the tenant context in your API calls.
