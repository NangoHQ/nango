## API gotchas

- When a user authorizes your app, they select which Xero organization to connect. Your app can only access data for the selected organization.
- If you need to work with multiple Xero organizations, you'll need to handle the tenant context in your API calls. After a connection is created, Nango will automatically fetch and store the `tenant_id` in the connection config, which you can then use in your API calls.
- Make sure you add the `offline_access` scope to ensure the token refreshes as expected
