## Connection configuration in Nango

- AutoTask requires a zone-specific subdomain for API access
- The API Integration Code is used for tracking and must be included in headers
- Authentication uses Basic Auth with username/password credentials

## API gotchas

- AutoTask requires the API Integration Code to be passed in the `APIIntegrationCode` header for all requests
- The API zone (subdomain) varies by account and must be determined for each customer
- API rate limits apply and vary by account type
