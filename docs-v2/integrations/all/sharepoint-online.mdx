## API gotchas
-   Nango supports both SharePoint Online v1 and v2, providing flexibility for integrations depending on your requirements. SharePoint v1 refers to the older REST API, which uses legacy authentication methods like SharePoint Online (SPO) or older OAuth implementations. Its endpoints follow the pattern `https://<your-tenant>.sharepoint.com/_api/`, and it supports basic SharePoint operations. However, v1 lacks modern features such as delta queries for incremental sync and deep integration with Microsoft 365.
-   Sharepoint Online v2, on the other hand, is a modernized version aligned with the Microsoft Graph API. It uses OAuth 2.0 with the Microsoft Identity Platform (formerly Azure AD) for secure and scalable authentication. Endpoints for v2 are primarily accessed through `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/...`, and it offers advanced capabilities like delta queries for incremental sync, enhanced performance, and seamless integration with Microsoft 365 services.
-   You can find permissions required for each API call in their corresponding API methods section, i.e, to get metadata for a list from Sharepoint, you can have a look at [Get metadata for a list permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/list-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http#permissions).
