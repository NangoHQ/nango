## API gotchas

<ZohoSharedGotchas />

### CRM-specific gotchas
- You can make your OAuth app cross-data-centers with [these instructions](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v3/multi-dc.html). This means that a single OAuth app will be able to query the Zoho API for Zoho accounts from the US, EU, etc.
- The Zoho CRM API has a [rate limit](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v3/rate-limit.html) of 25,000 API requests per day per organization.
