## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Google Cloud account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new project">
    1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    2. Click on the project dropdown at the top of the page.
    3. Click **New Project**.
    4. Enter a name for your project and click **Create**.
    5. Wait for the project to be created and then select it from the project dropdown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable the APIs you need">
    1. Go to the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) in the Google Cloud Console.
    2. Search for the Google APIs you want to use (e.g., Google Drive API, Gmail API, Google Calendar API).
    3. Select each API and click **Enable**.
    4. Repeat this process for all the APIs your application needs to access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the OAuth consent screen">
    1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen** in the Google Cloud Console.
    2. Select the appropriate user type:
       - **External**: For applications available to any Google user
       - **Internal**: For applications restricted to users within your Google Workspace organization
    3. Click **Create**.
    4. Fill in the required information:
       - **App name**: Your application's name
       - **User support email**: Your email address
       - **Developer contact information**: Your email address
    5. Click **Save and Continue**.
    6. Add the scopes your application needs. Click **Add or Remove Scopes** and select the scopes that correspond to the APIs you enabled.
    7. Click **Save and Continue**.
    8. Add test users if you selected External user type (required for testing before verification).
    9. Click **Save and Continue**.
    10. Review your settings and click **Back to Dashboard**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create OAuth 2.0 credentials">
    1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** in the Google Cloud Console.
    2. Click **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
    3. Select **Web application** as the application type.
    4. Enter a name for your OAuth client.
    5. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
    6. Click **Create**.
    7. A dialog will appear with your client ID and client secret. Save these credentials securely as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure additional settings (optional)">
    1. If your application requires offline access (to refresh tokens when the user is not present), ensure you set the `access_type` parameter to `offline` in your authorization request.
    2. If your application needs incremental authorization (requesting additional scopes over time), set the `include_granted_scopes` parameter to `true`.
    3. For enhanced security, implement state parameter validation to prevent CSRF attacks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify your app (if required)">
    If your application uses sensitive or restricted scopes, you'll need to verify your app with Google:
    1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen**.
    2. Click **Edit App**.
    3. Complete all required information, including privacy policy URL.
    4. Submit your app for verification by clicking **Submit for verification**.
    5. Follow Google's instructions to complete the verification process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connection configuration in Nango

Google uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. You can configure your connection in Nango using the standard authorization flow:

```js
nango.auth('google', '<CONNECTION-ID>');
```

When configuring your integration in Nango, you can specify the scopes your application requires. Google has a wide range of available scopes for different APIs. For example:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` - Read-only access to Google Drive
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` - Send emails via Gmail
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` - Full access to Google Calendar

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui).

## API gotchas

-   Google has a unified OAuth system for their various APIs. This provider should work for most of them (e.g. Google Sheets, Gmail, Google Calendar, etc.).
-   You need to enable individual Google APIs on the [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) before using them.
-   Under certain circumstances, Google expires a user's refresh token and the token refresh in Nango will fail. You can find a [list of reasons from Google here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#expiration).
-   While setting up the OAuth credentials, the _Authorized JavaScript origins_ should be your site URL (`https://app.nango.dev` if you're testing from the Nango UI).
-   For applications using sensitive or restricted scopes, Google requires verification and a security assessment. This process can take several weeks to complete.
-   Google's OAuth consent screen has different configurations for "External" and "Internal" user types. Internal is only available for Google Workspace users and limits access to users within your organization.
-   When requesting offline access, make sure to set `access_type=offline` and `prompt=consent` to ensure you receive a refresh token.
-   Google implements incremental authorization, allowing you to request additional scopes over time without requiring users to re-authorize all previously granted scopes.
-   Google has [rate limits](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/limits) for OAuth requests that vary by API.
-   For enhanced security, always implement state parameter validation to prevent CSRF attacks.
