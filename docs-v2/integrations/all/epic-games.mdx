## Useful links

-   Register your app on the [Dev Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/portal)
-   Nango implements the [Auth Web APIs mentioned here](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/web-api-ref/authentication) (specifically, it implements the `authorization code` flow).

## API gotchas

-   I could not find a public list of possible scopes, but there is a list when you setup your app in the dev portal.
-   The refresh token has a very aggressive time out of just a few hours - make API requests very frequently (to refresh it) or you will lose access!
-   Epic [returns many things](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/web-api-ref/authentication#requesting-an-access-token) (scroll down for an example) together with the access token. Use the `getRawTokenRepsonse` methods of the Nango SDK to access these. You can get even more additional information by [inspecting the access token](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/web-api-ref/authentication#account-information).
