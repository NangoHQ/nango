4. You'll see two types of keys:
   - **Publishable Key**: Starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_` (for frontend use)
   - **Secret Key**: Starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_` (for backend use - this is what you need)

5. Copy your **Secret Key**

<Warning>
Keep your Secret Key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories. This key provides full access to your Clerk backend API.
</Warning>

<Info>
If you're just testing the integration, use your development key (`sk_test_...`). For production, use your live key (`sk_live_...`).
