## Step 1: Retrieve your Clerk Secret Key

To connect to Clerk, you'll need to obtain your Secret Key from the Clerk Dashboard.

1. Sign in to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Select your application (or create one if you haven't already)
3. Navigate to **Configure** > **Developers** > **API Keys**
4. You'll see two types of keys:
   - **Publishable Key**: Starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_` (for frontend use)
   - **Secret Key**: Starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_` (for backend use - this is what you need)
5. Copy your **Secret Key**

<Warning>
Keep your Secret Key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories. This key provides full access to your Clerk backend API.
</Warning>

<Info>
If you're just testing the integration, use your development key (`sk_test_...`). For production, use your live key (`sk_live_...`).

## Step 2: Enter your Secret Key in Nango

Once you have your Clerk Secret Key:

1. In the Nango UI, create a new connection for Clerk
2. Paste your Secret Key in the **Secret Key** field
3. Click **Save** to test the connection

The connection will be verified by making a test request to the Clerk API.

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid API Key Error

If you receive an authentication error:
- Ensure you're using the Secret Key (starts with `sk_`) not the Publishable Key (starts with `pk_`)
- Check that you haven't accidentally included extra spaces or characters when copying the key
- Verify you're using the correct environment key (test vs. live)

### Connection Timeout

If the connection times out:
- Check your network connectivity
- Ensure your Clerk application is active and not suspended
- Try regenerating your API keys in the Clerk Dashboard
