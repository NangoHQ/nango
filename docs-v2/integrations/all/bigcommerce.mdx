## API gotchas

- BigCommerce offers various apps with different levels of visibility. For more details, see [BigCommerce types of Apps](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/integrations/apps/guide/types)
- After creating a new connection on Nango, you will need to rewrite your HTTP request headers to use the `X-Auth-Token` header to pass the API account's `access_token` instead of the Authorization header as described in [here](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/start/authentication/api-accounts#how-to-migrate). Please look at the following example:

```js
        const connection = await nango.getConnection();

        if (!connection.credentials || typeof connection.credentials !== 'object') {
            throw new nango.ActionError({
                message: `credentials are missing or invalid`
            });
        }

        let access_token: string;
        if ('access_token' in connection.credentials) {
            access_token = connection.credentials.access_token;
        } else {
            throw new nango.ActionError({
                message: `access_token is missing`
            });
        }

        const config = {
            endpoint: '/v2/orders',
            headers: {
                'X-Auth-Token': access_token
            }
        };

        const response = await nango.get(config);
