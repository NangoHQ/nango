## API gotchas

- BigCommerce offers various apps with different levels of visibility. For more details, see [BigCommerce types of Apps](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/integrations/apps/guide/types)
- After creating a new connection on Nango, you will need to rewrite your HTTP request headers to use the `X-Auth-Token` header to pass the API account's `access_token` instead of the Authorization header as described in [here](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/start/authentication/api-accounts#how-to-migrate). Please look at the following example:

```js
const connection = await nango.getConnection();

if (!connection.credentials || typeof connection.credentials !== 'object') {
    throw new nango.ActionError({
        message: `credentials are missing or invalid`
    });
}

let access_token: string;
if ('access_token' in connection.credentials) {
    access_token = connection.credentials.access_token;
} else {
    throw new nango.ActionError({
        message: `access_token is missing`
    });
}

const config = {
    endpoint: '/v2/orders',
    headers: {
        'X-Auth-Token': access_token
    }
};

const response = await nango.get(config);

```
