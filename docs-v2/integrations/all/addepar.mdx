    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Addepar_. Nango doesn't provide a test OAuth app for Addepar yet. You’ll need to set up your own by following these [instructions](#🧑%E2%80%8D💻-oauth-app-setup). After that, make sure to add the OAuth client ID, secret, and [scopes](https://developers.addepar.com/docs/oauth#scopes) in the integration settings in Nango.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Addepar">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Addepar. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Addepar API">
        Let's make your first request to the Addepar API (fetch a list of all entities). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl -X GET "https://api.nango.dev/v1/entities" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>" \
                ```
            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            // Lists all entities.
            const res = await nango.get({
              // https://developers.addepar.com/docs/entities#get-all-entities
              endpoint: '/v1/entities',
              providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
              connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>',
            });

            console.log(res.data);
            ```
            </Tab>

        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

      </Step>
