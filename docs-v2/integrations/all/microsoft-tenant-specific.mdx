## Useful links

-   [Create an Azure app registration for the specific application](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908).
    -   Add permissions for the appropriate app on the `API Permissions` tab
-   [OAuth-related docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow).
    -   See particularly the `tenant` parameter under [Request an authorization code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code).
        This `tenant` parameter must be provided as [extra configuration to the frontend SDK](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).
-   [List of OAuth scopes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/permissions-consent-overview)
    -   The specific scopes required will depend on the application being accessed.  This might use the [.default scope with the resource's identifier URI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#the-default-scope).

This endpoint supports services authorized using an Azure App Registration in any accessible tenant, including:

> - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations

<Tip>You _can_ use this provider for general Microsoft Graph access (and the major Microsoft SaaS services like Teams, OneDrive, other Office 365 services, etc.) by setting the `tenant` to `common` but we recommend using the [Microsoft Teams provider](/integrations/all/microsoft-teams) instead which includes sync capability.</Tip>


## API gotchas

-   If you are developing an app for users within your own organization and the app has already been granted adequate permissions at the organization level with user consent turned off, you must override the integration config when calling the create connect session method:
    - Override `authorization_params` by setting only `response_type: code` to remove the consent screen (this removes both `response_mode` and `prompt`).
    - Set the scopes to [`.default`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#the-default-scope) to ensure the permissions remain the same as those granted at the organization level.

```typescript
const { data } = await nango.createConnectSession({
  [...],
  integrations_config_defaults: {
    "microsoft-tenant-specific": {
      authorization_params: {
        response_type: 'code',
        scope: '.default'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

If this is not done, the app will [show a consent screen prompting the user to grant permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#example-1-the-user-or-tenant-admin-has-granted-permissions) which the user will be unable to do without admin access.
