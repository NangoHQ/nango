## API gotchas

- Basic authentication requires your Atlassian account email and an API token. Never use your account password.
- Because Confluence permits anonymous access by default, it does not supply a typical authentication challenge. Some HTTP clients may behave unexpectedly.
- When making API calls, remember that the permissions of your Atlassian account will limit what you can access, regardless of the authentication method.
- The Confluence REST API has different versions. Make sure you're using the correct version for your needs.
- Your API token is sensitive information - keep it secure and never share it.
- Basic authentication is recommended for scripts and manual API calls. For production applications, consider using [OAuth 2.0 ](https://docs.nango.dev/integrations/all/confluence) instead.
