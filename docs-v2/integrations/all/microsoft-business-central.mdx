## API gotchas
-   See particularly the `tenantId` parameter under [Get a token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow#get-a-token).
-   This `tenantId` parameter must be provided as [extra configuration to the frontend SDK](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).
-   When requesting **Application Permissions** that require admin consent, an Microsoft Entra ID administrator must pre-authorize the permissions. Without admin consent, the app cannot obtain tokens for those scopes.
-   For multitenant applications, each tenant administrator must grant consent to the app’s required permissions before access is granted in their tenant.
-  The [.default scope](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#default-when-the-user-gives-consent) is a special scope that tells Azure AD to issue a token containing all the **Application Permissions** that have already been granted (consented) for your app on that resource. Using `.default` ensures your app receives permissions consistent with those configured and consented at the tenant or organization level.
-   The `.default` scope can't be combined with the scopes registered in the Azure portal. So either just use the `.default` scope or remove it to list out explicit parameters that are required. If you attempt to combine them you'll receive the following error
```
.default scope can't be combined with resource-specific scopes
```
-   No user interaction is involved when using the Microsoft Business Central provider. Therefore, a Microsoft Entra ID administrator must grant consent for the required **Application Permissions** ahead of time. This can be done through the [Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/grant-admin-consent?pivots=portal) or by using the [admin consent endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/grant-admin-consent?pivots=ms-graph).
