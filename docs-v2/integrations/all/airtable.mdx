## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Airtable account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for an [Airtable account](https://airtable.com/signup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register a new OAuth integration">
    1. Go to the [OAuth integrations panel](https://airtable.com/create/oauth) in your Airtable account.
    2. Click **Register new OAuth integration**.
    3. Enter a unique name for your integration.
    4. Add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` as your OAuth redirect URI.
    5. Click **Register integration**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth integration">
    After creating your integration, you'll be taken to the management page where you can configure the following properties:

    1. **Name**: You can update the name of your integration if needed.
    2. **OAuth redirect URI**: Verify that `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` is set correctly.
    3. **Permission scopes**: Select the scopes your application requires. Common scopes include:
       - `data.records:read` - Read records from bases
       - `data.records:write` - Create, update, and delete records
       - `data.recordComments:read` - Read record comments
       - `data.recordComments:write` - Create, update, and delete record comments
       - `schema.bases:read` - Read base schema information
    4. **Tagline** (optional): Add a brief description of what your integration does.
    5. **Homepage URL** (optional): Add your website or homepage URL.
    6. **Logo** (optional): Upload a logo for your integration.
    7. **Support email** (optional): Add an email address where users can reach you for support.
    8. **Privacy policy URL** (required to share integration): Add your privacy policy URL.
    9. **Terms of service URL** (required to share integration): Add your terms of service URL.

    Click **Save changes** when you're done.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate a client secret">
    1. On your integration's management page, click **Generate client secret**.
    2. Confirm the action by clicking **Generate**.
    3. Copy the client secret that appears. Note that this is the only time you'll see this secret, so make sure to store it securely.
    4. Click **Done** after copying the secret.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain your client ID">
    Your client ID is displayed on your integration's management page. You'll need both the client ID and client secret when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview the user authorization dialog">
    You can preview what users will see when authorizing your integration by clicking the **Preview authorization dialog** button on your integration's management page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your integration available to users">
    To make your integration available to other users, you must add:
    - A support email
    - A privacy policy URL
    - A terms of service URL

    Once these are added and saved, other users will be able to authorize your integration.
  </Step>
