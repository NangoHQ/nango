# Overview

To authenticate with Atlassian Cloud Admin, you will need:
1. **API Key** - A key that grants Nango permission to interact with Atlassian Cloud Admin APIs resources and services.
2. **Organization ID** - ID that is associated with your Atlassian organization. This is optional.

This guide will walk you through generating your **API Key** within Atlassian.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an account with Atlassian.

#### Step 1: Generating your API Key
- To authenticate with Atlassian Cloud Admin APIs, you’ll need to generate an API key. You can choose between:
* **API key with scopes** – More secure, allows fine-grained access control.
* **API key without scopes** – Broader access, potentially less secure.

1. Go to [https://admin.atlassian.com](https://admin.atlassian.com).
2. Select your organization (if you have more than one).
3. Navigate to **Settings** > **API keys**.
4. If this is your first **API key**, click **Create your API Key**. If you've already created **API keys** before, click **Create API key** in the top-right corner of the page.

4. Choose one of the following options:
   * **To create a scoped key**: Click **API keys with scopes**, then click **Next**.
   * **To create an unscoped key**: Click **API keys without scopes**, then **Next**.

5. Enter a **Name** for the key that helps identify its purpose (e.g., `"User Sync Script"`).
6. Select an **Expiration Date** (API keys can last a maximum of **1 year**).

7. (For scoped keys only) Under **Select scopes**, choose the appropriate [permissions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/scopes/) for your use case.

9. Click **Create API Key**.
10. Copy and securely save the API key when prompted — you won’t be able to view it again later.
11. Copy and save the organization ID. You can optionally enter this in the Connect UI.

#### Step 2: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **API Key**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Atlassian Cloud Admin.
2. Enter your **API Key** in its respective field.
3. Optionally enter your **Organization ID** in the correct field.
4. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
