# Overview

To authenticate with Pax8, you need two key pieces of information:
1. **Client ID** - Your Pax8 API Client ID from the Integrations Hub
2. **Client Secret** - Your Pax8 API Client Secret from the Integrations Hub


This guide will walk you through finding or creating those credentials within Pax8.


### Prerequisites:

- You must be a Pax8 Partner with Partner Admin or Primary Partner Admin role
- Access to the Pax8 Partner Portal


#### Step 1: Get Your Pax8 Credentials

1. Log into your Pax8 Partner Portal at [https://app.pax8.com](https://app.pax8.com)

2. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations** or go directly to [https://app.pax8.com/integrations?tab=credentials](https://app.pax8.com/integrations?tab=credentials)

3. In the Credentials tab, you'll find your API credentials:
   - **Client ID**: Your unique application identifier
   - **Client Secret**: Your application secret (click to reveal)

Important: Only Partner Admin and Primary Partner Admin roles can access and generate API credentials.


#### Step 2: Connect Your Pax8 Account

To authenticate using your API credentials, navigate to the Pax8 authentication form.
Enter your credentials as follows:
- **Client ID**: Your Pax8 API Client ID
- **Client Secret**: Your Pax8 API Client Secret

Click "Connect" to complete the authentication.

Note: Pax8 uses OAuth2 Client Credentials flow, so no user authorization step is required - the integration will authenticate directly with your provided credentials.
