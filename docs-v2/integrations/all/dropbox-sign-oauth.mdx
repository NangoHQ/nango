## API gotchas

- Dropbox Sign requires production approval for apps using OAuth. Your app cannot be authorized or added by other users until it is approved for production.
- You can test OAuth by authorizing your app from your own account while building.
- The OAuth flow supports two scenarios:
  1. Authorization code flow - for users with existing Dropbox Sign accounts
  2. Account creation flow - for new users to Dropbox Sign
- Access tokens are only valid for about an hour. You'll need to use the refresh token to generate new access tokens.
- When creating an app, you'll need to provide:
  - App name
  - OAuth callback URL
  - Scopes (actions your app will be allowed to perform)
