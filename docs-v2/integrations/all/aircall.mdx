  <Tab title="🚀 Quickstart">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Aircall_.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Aircall">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Aircall. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Aircall API">
        Let's make your first request to the Aircall API (fetch a list of users). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/v1/users" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
                ```

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            const res = await nango.get({
              endpoint: '/v1/users',
              providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
              connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
            });

            console.log(res.data);
            ```
            </Tab>

        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.

    <Tip>
    Next step: [Embed the auth flow](/getting-started/quickstart/embed-in-your-app) in your app to let your users connect their Aircall accounts.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
    <Tab title="🧑‍💻 OAuth app setup">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a partner-specific account">
        If you don't already have one, sign up for a [partner-specific account](https://aircall.io/partners/technology/signup/)
      </Step>
      <Step title="Prepare your URIs">
        Before proceeding, make sure you have these URIs ready:
        - **redirect_uri**: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
        - **install_uri**: Your application's setup page URL. To satisfy Aircall's requirement, you can provide a link that shows users what the app is about. This is only necessary if you are initiating the authorization flow outside Nango; since you are initiating it within Nango, it is not required.

        Refer to the [Aircall OAuth documentation](https://developer.aircall.io/api-references/#oauth-technology-partners) to understand how these URIs are used in the OAuth process.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Request OAuth credentials">
        1. Email [marketplace@aircall.io](mailto:marketplace@aircall.io) and request OAuth credentials.
        2. In your message, mention that you're building a Technology Partner app and provide your **install_uri** and **redirect_uri**.
        3. Aircall will reply with your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** once approved, you'll need these when configuring your integration in Nango.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Next">
        Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).

  <Tab title="🚨 API gotchas">
    - Aircall requires becoming a technology partner before you can create OAuth applications.
    - Rate limiting applies to API requests. Check the [rate limiting documentation](https://developer.aircall.io/api-references/#rate-limiting) for current limits.
    - Some API endpoints may require specific scopes or permission levels.
