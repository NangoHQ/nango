# Overview

To authenticate with Snipe-IT, you need:
1. **API Token** - A token that grants Nango permission to interact with Snipe-IT's API resources and services.
2. **Domain** - Your Snipe-IT instance URL (e.g., yourcompany.snipe-it.io).

This guide will walk you through obtaining these credentials within Snipe-IT.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an account with Snipe-IT (either self-hosted or cloud instance).
- You must have admin privileges to generate API tokens.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding Your Domain and API Token

1. Log in to your Snipe-IT instance (e.g., `https://yourcompany.snipe-it.io`).
2. Navigate to **Account** > **API Keys** from the top-right user menu.
3. Click **Create New Token**.
4. Enter a **Name** for your token (e.g., "Nango Integration").
5. Click **Save** to generate the token.
6. Copy the generated API token immediately (it will only be shown once).
7. Note your domain URL (the part before `/admin` in your browser URL).

<Note>For the demo instance at [demo.snipe-it.io](https://demo.snipe-it.io), you can use username `admin` and password `password` to test the integration.</Note>

#### Step 2: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **API Token** and **Domain**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Snipe-IT.
2. Enter your **Domain** (e.g., `yourcompany.snipe-it.io` - without `https://`).
3. Enter your **API Token** in its respective field.
4. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.

You are now connected to Snipe-IT.
