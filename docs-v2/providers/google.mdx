- [Google scopes](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes)

## API specific gotchas[](#api-specific-gotchas "Direct link to API specific gotchas")

- Google has a unified OAuth system for their various APIs. This provider should
  work for most of them (e.g. GSheet, Gmail, Google Calendar, etc.)
- You need to enable individual Google API on the
  [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) before
  using them
- While setting up the OAuth credentials, the _Authorized JavaScript origins_
  should be your site URL (`http://localhost:8000` if you're doing the
  [Quickstart](/quickstart) locally)
