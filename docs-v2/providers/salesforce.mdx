## Using Salesforce with Nango[](#using-salesforce-with-nango "Direct link to Using Salesforce with Nango")

Provider template name in Nango: `salesforce`  
Follow our [quickstart](/quickstart) to add an OAuth integration with Salesforce
in 5 minutes.

**Metadata captured by Nango**  
The `instance_url` is automatically stored in the
[Connection Metadata](/reference/core-concepts#metadata) when it gets the access
token.

## App registration & publishing[](#app-registration--publishing "Direct link to App registration & publishing")

Quick & easy for testing:

- Sign up for a Salesforce developer account.
- Login and in Setup create a new "Connected App" under `Apps -> App Manager`.
  Make sure you enable the OAuth section.

## Useful links[](#useful-links "Direct link to Useful links")

## API specific gotchas[](#api-specific-gotchas "Direct link to API specific gotchas")

- Salesforce calls the `client_id` and `client_secret` the `Consumer Key` and
  `Consumer Secret`
- To enable offline data access with a refresh token, add the `refresh_token`
  (or its synonym, `offline_access`) scope. By default access tokens expire in
  \~2h (but customers can configure this value).
- If you encounter an error in your flow that says `invalid_client_id`
  [make sure your (developer) User's password does not contain any special characters](https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=906F00000009ABLIA2)
  (yes, really.)
- Nango automatically stores the `instance_url` (e.g.
  `https://yourInstance.salesforce.com/`) in the
  [Connection metadata](/reference/core-concepts#metadata) for you. You can
  easily retrieve this with the
  [backend SDK](/reference/node-sdk#connectionDetails) or
  [Connections API](/reference/connections-api#connectionDetails)
