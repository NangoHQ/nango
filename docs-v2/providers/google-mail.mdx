## Using Gmail with Nango[](#using-gmail-with-nango "Direct link to Using Gmail with Nango")

Gmail uses the same OAuth mechanism as other Google services. Please use the
Google template for it in Nango: `google`  
Follow our [quickstart](/quickstart) to add an OAuth integration with the Gmail
API in 5 minutes.

## App registration & publishing[](#app-registration--publishing "Direct link to App registration & publishing")

Google's APIs all use the same OAuth service. To which APIs you get access is
determined by the scopes that you request.

Please check the main [Google OAuth API wiki](/providers/google) here for
details on how to register an OAuth app with Google.
