## ⭐ Nango Sync at a glance

Nango Sync lets you make requests and sync data with external APIs, on behalf of users. It works in isolation and seamlessly integrates with [Nango Auth](/nango-auth).

It supports:

-   bi-directional continuous syncing
-   synchronous/asynchronous reads & writes
-   real-time updates with webhooks
-   rate-limit & retry handling
-   auto-pagination & incremental syncing
-   monitoring & an admin console

## 👩‍💻 How it looks in my code

1-liner to fetch structured objects from any external API:

```js
nango.github().issues('<user-id>');
```

## 100+ pre-configured APIs, easily add your own
