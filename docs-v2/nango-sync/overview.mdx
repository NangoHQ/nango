Nango Sync takes care of:

## 👩‍💻 How it looks in my code

1-liner in your frontend to let users connect a new integration (powered by [Nango Auth](/nango-auth)):

```js
nango.auth('github', '<user-id>');
```

Nango then automatically starts the continuous syncs for this new [connection](/core-concepts#connections).

1-liner to fetch the synced data from any external API in your backend:

```js
nango.getRecords({
    providerConfigKey: 'github',
    connectionId: '<user-id>',
    model: 'GithubIssues', // Or anything else you want to sync
});
```
