title: "Observability"
description:
  "Observability is some of the most time-consuming infrastructure to set up
  when building external integrations in-house. To relieve engineering teams
  from this burden, Nango aims at providing powerful out-of-the-box tooling for
  observing interactions with external APIs."

While we will continue to make Nango more observable, there are already multiple
ways that you can observe and debug Nango Syncs:

## Inspect Sync jobs in the DB[](#inspect-sync-jobs-in-the-db "Direct link to Inspect Sync jobs in the DB")

Sync jobs are the individual runs of Syncs. You can access all the information
about Sync job execution in Nango's destination database, in the table
`_nango_jobs` within the schema `nango`.

Each jobs displays information about:

- Start and end time
- Status
- Error message (in case of failure)
- Error stack trace (in case of failure)
- Added/updated/deleted/unchanged row counts (in case of success)
- Page count
- Attempts

## Inspect logs[](#inspect-logs "Direct link to Inspect logs")

When you run Nango locally with docker compose you can view the combined logs
for all Nango containers, in real-time, with this command:

```bash
docker compose logs --follow
```

By default, Nango logs info-level messages and above. You can make logs more
verbose by setting `LOG_LEVEL` to `debug` (or less verbose by setting it to
`error`) in the `.env` file.

## Temporal Admin Panel[](#temporal-admin-panel "Direct link to Temporal Admin Panel")

Additionally, as Nango uses [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) to orchestrates
Sync jobs, you can further debug Sync job executions by logging to the Temporal
admin panel.

To enable the Temporal UI, you should run the `debug` Docker compose with the
following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.debug.yaml up
```

You can now view, debug and control Temporal workflows (corresponding to Sync
jobs) on the Temporal UI at http://localhost:8011.
