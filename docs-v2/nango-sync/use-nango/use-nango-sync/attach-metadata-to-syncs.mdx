title: "Attach metadata to Syncs"
---

You can attach arbitrary metadata to each synced row using the `metadata` field
in the [Sync config options](/nango-sync/use-nango/use-nango-sync/create-syncs).

This is useful if you want to query the synced data based on fields from your
other SQL tables (e.g. `user_id`, `company_id`, etc.).

## Problems with your Sync? We are here to help!

If you need help or run into issues, please reach out! We are online and
responsive all day on the [Slack Community](https://nango.dev/slack).
