## Sync Modes[](#sync-modes "Direct link to Sync Modes")

Nango supports the following syncing modes:

- **Full Refresh + Overwrite**: on each job, read all the objects from the API,
  overwrite by first deleting existing rows
- **Full Refresh + Upsert**: on each job, read all the objects from the API,
  append new rows & update existing rows (see below)
- **Incremental + Upsert** (coming soon): on each job, only read the new/updated
  objects from the API, append new rows & update existing rows

The **Full Refresh + Overwrite** mode is used by default. To use the **Full
Refresh + Upsert** mode (recommended), provide a right value for the
`unique_key` field in the
[Sync config options](/nango-sync/use-nango/use-nango-sync/create-syncs), the
value of which will be used to dedupe rows.

## Deletion Modes[](#deletion-modes "Direct link to Deletion Modes")

Nango supports the following deletion modes:

- **Hard Delete** (default): records to delete are removed from the database
- **Soft Delete**: records to delete are maintained in the db with a deletion
  date in the 'deleted_at' column.

Specify the Deletion Mode using the `soft_delete` boolean field in the
[Sync config options](/nango-sync/use-nango/use-nango-sync/create-syncs).
