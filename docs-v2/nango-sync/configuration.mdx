## External requests & Auth

Nango lets you configure which external endpoints you consume, in code, without constraint, using the [Nango Proxy](/nango-sync/guides/direct-requests).

It will automatically handle:

-   authorization (with Nango Auth)
-   logging & monitoring
-   rate-limits & retries
-   pagination and more

## Schemas & transformation

Nango lets you define, in code:

1.  the output schema of the synced objects
2.  the mapping between the external API schema and the output schema

With this, Nango will ensure end-to-end type safety as well as monitor changes in API response schemas.

## Scheduling

Define on which schedule Nango should sync external data (e.g. `every hour`) in the `nango.yaml` config file.

## Rate-limits & Retry

Nango handles integration-wide rate-limits, pacing requests across all syncs.

Nango lets you define custom retry strategies, in the `nango.yaml` config file, and uses a sensible default.

## Auto-pagination

Used Nango's pre-defined pagination strategy to simplify you integration code, e.g.:

```ts
nango.get('/endpoint', { paginated = true }); // Fetches all pages automatically.
```

## Sync notifications

Nango uses webhooks to notify your app in real-time when new data is available. Webhook payloads are strongly-typed and contain added/updated/deleted objects.

## Manage syncs

Create, update, pause, re-trigger, stop syncs programmatically or with the admin console.

## Monitoring

Monitor all sync executions in the `Activity` tab of the admin console.
