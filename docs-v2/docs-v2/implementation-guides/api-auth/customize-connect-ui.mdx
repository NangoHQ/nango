You have two options for customizing the authentication experience for your users:

1. **Customize Connect UI** (recommended) - The easiest approach with built-in customization options
2. **Build a custom UI from scratch** - Full control but requires more development work

## Option 1: Customize Connect UI (recommended)

The Connect UI now supports several customization options that let you match your brand without building from scratch:

- **Brand color customization** - Set your primary brand color to match your application's theme
- **Remove Nango watermark** - Hide the Nango branding for a seamless user experience
- **Custom styling** - Additional styling options to integrate with your design system

This is the **easiest and fastest way** to provide a branded authentication experience. Learn more about [implementing the Connect UI with customization options](/implementation-guides/api-auth/implement-api-auth).

## Option 2: Build a custom UI from scratch

If you need complete control over the authentication flow and UI, you can build your own interface using the Nango frontend SDK.

<Info>
Pre-requisites:
- complete the [Configure an integration](/implementation-guides/api-auth/configure-integration) guide
- generate a [Connect session token](/implementation-guides/api-auth/implement-api-auth#1-generate-a-session-token-backend)
</Info>

## Integrate the frontend SDK

In your frontend, initiate Nango ([reference](/reference/sdks/frontend#instantiate-the-frontend-sdk)):

```ts
import Nango from '@nangohq/frontend';

const nango = new Nango({ connectSessionToken: '<CONNECT-SESSION-TOKEN>' });
```

Initiate the authorization flow ([reference](/reference/sdks/frontend#collect-and-store-end-user-credentials)):

<Tabs>

<Tab title="OAuth">

For OAuth, the `nango.auth()` method will trigger the OAuth flow in a popup, to let the user log in to their external account.

```js
nango
    .auth('<INTEGRATION-ID>')
    .then((result) => {
        // Show success UI.
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        // Show failure UI.
    });
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="API Key">

For API keys, the `nango.auth()` method is used to store the end-user's API key (that you have previously collected from them).

```js
nango
    .auth('<INTEGRATION-ID>', {
        credentials: {
            apiKey: '<END-USER-API-KEY>'
        }
    })
    .then((result) => {
        // Show success UI.
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        // Show failure UI.
    });
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Basic Auth">

For Basic Auth, the `nango.auth()` method is used to store the end-user's username & password (that you have previously collected from them).

```js
nango
    .auth('<INTEGRATION-ID>', {
        credentials: {
            username: '<END-USER-API-KEY>',
            password: '<END-USER-PASSWORD>'
        }
    })
    .then((result) => {
        // Show success UI.
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        // Show failure UI.
    });
```
</Tab>

## Handle APIs requiring connection-specific configuration for authorization

Some APIs require connection-specific configuration (e.g. Zendesk, Shopify).

For example, Zendesk has the following authorization URL, where the subdomain is specific to a user's Zendesk account:

`https://<USER-SUBDOMAIN>.zendesk.com/oauth/authorizations/new`

When using the [Connect UI](/implementation-guides/api-auth/implement-api-auth), this information is collected from the end user with an automatically-generated form.

But when using a custom UI, you must provide this configuration when calling `nango.auth()` ([reference](/reference/sdks/frontend#collect-and-store-end-user-credentials)):

```js
nango.auth('zendesk', {
    params: { subdomain: '<ZENDESK-SUBDOMAIN>' }
});
```

In some cases you might want to override the scopes provided by an integration at the connection level. For this case you can pass in the scopes to `nango.auth`:

```js
nango.auth('zendesk', {
    params: { oauth_scopes_override: 'custom-connection-scope' }
});
```

This _connection configuration_ is stored in the connection. You can retrieve it with the SDK ([reference](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials)) and API ([reference](/reference/api/connection/get)), or see it in connection details in the Nango UI.

# Next
Once the authorization succeeds, [_save the connection ID_](/implementation-guides/api-auth/implement-api-auth#3-listen-for-webhooks-%26-save-the-connection-id-backend).
