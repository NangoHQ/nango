## Creating a sync variant

Sync variants allow you to create different configurations of the same sync for a specific connection. This is useful when you need to sync the same data with different settings or filters.

### Key features
- Each variant operates independently with its own sync schedule
- Variants can be queried separately through the records endpoint using the `variant` query parameter
- Cannot use "base" as a variant name (protected)

After creating a variant, you can use the `/records` endpoint to access its data by specifying the variant query parameter:

```
GET /records?model=MyModel&variant=MyVariant
```
