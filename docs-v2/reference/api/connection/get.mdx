title: 'Get connection & credentials'
openapi: 'GET /connection/{connectionId}'

<Info>

The response content depends on the API authentication type (e.g: OAuth 2, OAuth 1, API key, etc.).

If you do not want to deal with collecting & injecting credentials in requests for multiple authentication types, use the Proxy([step-by-step guide](/guides/proxy-requests)).

</Info>

<Tip>
Every time you fetch the connection with this API endpoint, Nango will check if the access token has expired. If it has, it will refresh it.

**We recommend you always fetch the token just before you use it to make sure it is fresh!**
