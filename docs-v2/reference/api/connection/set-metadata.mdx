## Set _connection metadata_

Nango uses the request body as the new metadata (it must be a JSON object). Note that this overrides any existing metadata. The connection_id must be passed in the body as well. Note that the connection_id can be a single string or an array of strings.

## Fetching _connection metadata_

To read the existing metadata of a _connection_, simply fetch the connection. Your custom metadata is included as part of the returned connection object.
