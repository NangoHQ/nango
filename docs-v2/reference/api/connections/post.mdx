## When to use

Use this API endpoint to import existing access tokens into Nango. It is mostly meant for one-off bulk imports when onboarding Nango.

To trigger OAuth flows with Nango, use the [Nango frontend SDK](/reference/sdks/frontend).

## Request body

You can use this endpoint to import OAuth 2, OAuth 1, API Keys, and Basic auth credentials.

The required fields depend on the type of authentication of the _connections_ you are trying to import.
