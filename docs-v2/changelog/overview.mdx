## Connect UI settings

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/changelog/connect-ui-settings.png" alt="Connect UI settings" />
</Frame>

Customize the Connect UI, which your users see when they authorize integrations.

We've added a dark mode and the ability to change the primary color to fit your brand. You can also toggle the light/dark mode based on the user's system preference.

Access the Connect UI settings in your [Environment settings](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings). We will continue adding customization options over time.

---

## Improved deletion detection when syncing data

For APIs that don't support deletion detection, we've added a new interface to detect deletions on Nango's side when syncing data ([docs](/implementation-guides/syncs/deletion-detection#detecting-deletes-in-full-refresh-syncs)).

Inside your sync function, you can now call `nango.deleteRecordsFromPreviousExecutions('ModelName')` to detect deletions.

Please note that you should only use this function if you are performing a full sync. If you are syncing data incrementally, you can periodicaly resync the whole dataset to benefit from deletion detection.

---

## Custom credentials verification 

We added the ability to customize the credentials verification script, which is called when a new connection is created. For this, use the new `validate-connection` hook ([docs](/implementation-guides/platform/implement-event-handler)).  

This lets you verify your customers’ API credentials by testing them against specific endpoints that correspond to particular API scopes.

## TypeScript-based script configs

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/changelog/typescript-based-script-configs.png" alt="TypeScript-based script configs illustration" />
</Frame>

Integration scripts now use TypeScript for configuration, colocated with your script code. Benefits:
- Strong type safety
- Better tooling (auto-complete, linting)
- No custom syntax to learn

This makes writing and maintaining custom integrations simpler, whether you code them manually or generate them with an LLM. [Migration guide](/implementation-guides/migrations/migrate-to-zero-yaml).

---

## Developer updates distribution

You’ll now receive important developer updates about deprecations, breaking changes, and other integration-impacting news in a more structured way:
- **Email**: Sent to everyone who signs up (with the option to unsubscribe).
- **Private Slack channels**: Delivered directly if your team has a dedicated channel with us.
- **Community Slack**: Shared in the `#dev-updates` channel.
- **Docs**: Dedicated [Dev Updates changelog](/changelog/dev-updates).

---

## Separate rate limits for Script API vs. Public API
Script API calls and Public API calls are now rate-limited separately. This prevents heavy script usage from affecting your ability to use the Public API (and vice versa). Both limits are soft and can be increased per customer. Limits are now properly reported in the Nango logs.

---

## New getting started flow
A redesigned onboarding screen helps you set up your first integration and call an API right after signup. This makes it easier to experience Nango’s value in just a few minutes.

## Nango-provided OAuth apps for testing

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/changelog/nango-provided-oauth-apps.png" alt="Nango-provided OAuth apps for testing illustration" />
</Frame>

When testing OAuth APIs, you can now use Nango-provided developer apps instead of setting up your own.
- Available for top APIs (more being added over time).
- Select this option when creating a new integration.
- For **testing only**—production apps should still use your own credentials to keep Nango fully white-labeled.

---

## Edit user & org info
You can now edit the user and organization information attached to a connection. This info is visible in the Nango dashboard, helping you manage connections more easily.  
[API reference](/reference/api/connections/patch).

---

## Faster action execution
Action execution latency has been reduced from **more than 200ms+** to **less than 50ms**. This makes actions feel much more responsive, especially when a human is waiting for the result.

---

## API-specific docs with getting started
Each API-specific doc now includes a “Getting Started” section so you can:
1. Run the auth flow
2. Make a first successful API request

All in **under 5 minutes**. Example: [Google Calendar docs](/integrations/all/google-calendar).

- Track all metrics that affect billing.
- See past invoices with a full breakdown.

---

## Improved self-hosted release process
We’ve formalized the release process for self-hosted Enterprise customers:
- Two-month release cadence
- Semantic versioning adopted
- Clearer update process in the [self-hosting docs](/guides/self-hosting/enterprise-self-hosting/overview#updates).

## Nango as an MCP server

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/changelog/nango-as-an-mcp-server.png" alt="Nango as an MCP server illustration" />
</Frame>

Nango can now act as a remote MCP server, exposing third-party API actions as tools for your AI agents.
- Build and enable/disable tools with Nango actions.
- Use them via the MCP protocol.  
[Guide](/guides/use-cases/mcp-server).

---

## Localized Connect UI
You can now localize the Connect UI:
- Choose a language.
- Override links to end-user guides with your own versions.  
[Docs](/reference/sdks/frontend#param-lang).

---

## Asynchronous actions
You can now run actions asynchronously—triggering them without waiting for an immediate result. This is useful when:
- Tasks take a long time to complete.
- You don’t need the response right away.
- Actions should be retried for reliability.
- You’re sending many actions at once.  
[Docs](/implementation-guides/actions/async-actions).

---

## Granular time windows in logs
You can now filter logs by precise time windows, making it easier to drill down into specific events for debugging.

    ## Authorization logs

    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/changelog/authorization-logs.png" alt="Authorization logs illustration" />
    </Frame>

    Gain visibility into how your users interact with the Connect UI during the authorization process.

    Nango now tracks and logs key authorization events:

    - User opened or closed the Connect UI
    - User opened or closed the OAuth modal
    - User viewed a new screen (integration list, input form, success/failure)

    You can explore these events in the _Logs_ tab of the Nango UI.

    We also added a chart summarizing all authorization attempts by outcome:

    - Success
    - Cancelled
    - Technical failure

    This chart is available on the _Home_ tab.

    ## AI agent support

    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/changelog/ai-agent-support.png" alt="AI agent support illustration" />
    </Frame>

    We’ve added support for AI agents to consume Nango as part of automated workflows involving external APIs.

    Nango simplifies API orchestration, making it easier for AI agents to execute unitary, high-level actions without managing individual API calls or credentials.

    What’s new:

    - [**Introspection endpoint**](https://docs.nango.dev/reference/api/scripts/config): List available actions programmatically, exportable as OpenAI tools
    - [**Action trigger endpoint**](https://docs.nango.dev/reference/api/action/trigger): Run actions reliably via the API
    - [**Integrated authorization**](/guides/use-cases/api-auth): Use Nango’s pre-built UI to securely prompt users for access

    This makes it easier to build AI agents that can reliably interact with 400+ APIs.

    Get inspired by [AI companies using Nango](https://www.nango.dev/blog/nango-for-ai).

    ## Sync partitioning

    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/changelog/sync-partitioning.png" alt="Sync partitioning illustration" />
    </Frame>

    Syncing is now **faster and more efficient** with **Sync partinioning**. Instead of processing large syncs at once, you can now break them down into smaller, parallel syncs, improving performance and responsiveness.

    For example, instead of syncing an entire spreadsheet, you can sync each sheet separately so that each one syncs faster. This is ideal for large datasets or real-time syncing.

    The API and UI give you full control over these syncs, letting you create, manage, and monitor them with ease.

    ## Revamped environment settings

    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/changelog/revamped-environment-settings.png" alt="Revamped environment settings illustration" />
    </Frame>

    We overhauled the *Environment Settings* UI. This was one of the oldest sections of the app but is critical for setting up and configuring Nango.

    The new design organizes settings into clear sections: backend, notifications, scripts & export.

    Each setting now includes links to relevant documentation for easier navigation.

    Check it out in the *Environment Settings* tab in the [Nango UI](https://app.nango.dev/).

    ## Detailed webhook logs

    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/changelog/detailed-webhook-logs.png" alt="Detailed webhook logs illustration" />
    </Frame>

    Webhooks are a key part of Nango, notifying you of critical events such as authorization completion, sync completion, and error cases.

    We've added **granular logs** for all webhook types, allowing you to inspect individual webhook deliveries. You can now view the request/response payloads, filter by log type/status/timestamp and quickly debug failed webhook deliveries.

    Check it out in the *Logs* tab in the [Nango UI](https://app.nango.dev/).

    ## Real-time syncing strategies

    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/changelog/real-time-syncing-strategies.png" alt="Real-time syncing strategies illustration" />
    </Frame>

    Syncing real-time webhooks alongside periodic polling can cause conflicts, especially when APIs send partial updates. To solve this, we have introduced **new merging strategies** for better data accuracy.

    **How updates are handled**

    - **Deep merge (default)**: Nango merges partial updates automatically.
    - **Custom updates**: Fetch full records by ID and modify them manually.

    **How conflicts are resolved**

    - **Most recent update wins (default)**: The latest write—whether from a webhook or a periodic sync—always updates the record.
    - **Ignore older updates**: When polling, Nango checks if a newer webhook update exists. If so, it preserves the more recent webhook data instead of overwriting it.
