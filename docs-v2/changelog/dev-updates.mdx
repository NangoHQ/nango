  ## End-user info is no longer shared between connections

Currently, if multiple connections share the same `end_user_id`, they also share the same end-user object in Nango. After the change, each connection will always get its own independent copy of the end-user object, even if they use the same `end_user_id`. We are changing the old behavior because it was confusing for some developers, and it was impossible to declare multiple organizations for a given user.

  ### 🗓️ Timeline

  - **September 5, 2025**: End user updates will stop being replicated across connections.

  ### 🧐 Am I impacted?

  - If your users can be tied to multiple organizations
  - If you were relying on the end user auto-replication to maintain data freshness

  ### 💡 What should I do?

  End user fields are mostly for display and tagging purposes:
  - If you are not using them, you can safely ignore this update.

  - If you are using them, and wish to keep them in sync (e.g: display name, across connections) you will need to patch each connection when your end user is updated on your side


  ```ts
  await nango.patchConnection({
    connectionId,
    provider_config_key
  } , {
    end_user: {
      id: '123',
      email: 'new-email@nango.dev'
    }
  });
  ```

  NB: if you don't keep them in sync, the only side effect is that data will be stale in the Nango platform.

  There is no batch endpoint for this operation. If you need one, please reach out on Slack.

  ## Deprecation of `/connections` endpoints

  In this release, we've made some changes to the API that are breaking for some users.

  - All endpoints under `/connection` are now deprecated. Use the new `/connections` endpoint instead.
  They all, except one, take and return the same data. Only the base path has changed.

  - The endpoint `POST /connections` (previously `POST /connection`) now takes a different body, but returns the same data as previously.
  This new body is more flexible and ensure stricter typings on your side and validation on our side.

  - The endpoint `POST /connection/:connectionId/metadata` and `PATCH /connection/:connectionId/metadata` who have been deprecated for a while will not be migrated to /connections and will be removed at the end of the grace period.

  ### 🗓️ Timeline

  - **January 20, 2026**: All `/connection` endpoints will be removed.

  ### 🧐 Am I impacted?

  - If you manually use any endpoint under `/connection`
  - If you use the CLI
  - If you use the official Nango SDKs

  ### 💡 What should I do?

  - If you use the CLI, you should upgrade to `>=0.67.0`
  - If you use the official Nango SDKs, you should upgrade to `>=0.67.0`
  - If you manually use any endpoint under `/connection`, you should migrate to `/connections`
  - If you use the `POST /connection/:connectionId/metadata` or `PATCH /connection/:connectionId/metadata` endpoints, you should migrate to `/connections/metadata`
  - If you specifically use the `POST /connection` endpoint to import connections, check the migration section below.


  ### Migrating to `POST /connections`

  Only this endpoint requires a manual migration.
  Previously, the credentials were all at the root of the body.
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.nango.dev/v1/connection \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-secret-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider_config_key": "slack",
    "access_token": "some-access-token",
    [...]
  }'
  ```

  Now they are nested under the `credentials` key:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.nango.dev/v1/connections \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-secret-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider_config_key": "slack",
    "credentials": {
      "type": "OAUTH2",
      "access_token": "some-access-token",
      [...]
    }
  }'
  ```

  Please report any inconsistencies or issues with the new endpoints to support@nango.dev or in our slack community.

<Update label="July 21, 2025" description="v0.64.0" tags={["Breaking changes","CLI", "Scripts"]}>

  ## Deprecation of `nango.yaml` configuration file

The new script format is now officially released under `>=0.64.0`.
If you are already using it or have tried before, the only big change between beta and now is that we now use zod v4.
By upgrading to `>=0.64.0` and running `nango compile`, the CLI will update the dependency automatically; otherwise, you need to install zod: `4.0.5`

  ### 🗓️ Timeline

  - **December 1st, 2025**: `nango.yaml` support will be removed.

  ### 🧐 Am I impacted?

  - If you use custom scripts

  ### 💡 What should I do?

  - Follow migration guide -> https://docs.nango.dev/guides/custom-integrations/migrate-to-zero-yaml
