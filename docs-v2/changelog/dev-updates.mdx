  ## August 2025 API Breaking changes

  In this release, we've made some changes to the API that are breaking for some users.

  - All endpoints under `/connection` are now deprecated. Use the new `/connections` endpoint instead.
  They all, except one, take and return the same data. Only the base path has changed.

  - The endpoint `POST /connections` (previously `POST /connection`) now takes a different body, but returns the same data as previously.
  This new body is more flexible and ensure stricter typings on your side and validation on our side.

  - The endpoint `POST /connection/:connectionId/metadata` and `PATCH /connection/:connectionId/metadata` who have been deprecated for a while will not be migrated to /connections and will be removed at the end of the grace period.

  ### 🗓️ Timeline

  - **August 20, 2025**: We will start deprecating the `/connection` endpoints.
  - **January 20, 2026**: All `/connection` endpoints will be removed.

  ### 🧐 Am I impacted?

  - If you manually use any endpoint under `/connection`
  - If you use the CLI
  - If you use the official Nango SDKs

  ### 💡 What should I do?

  - If you use the CLI, you should upgrade to `>=0.67.0`
  - If you use the official Nango SDKs, you should upgrade to `>=0.67.0`
  - If you manually use any endpoint under `/connection`, you should migrate to `/connections`
  - If you use the `POST /connection/:connectionId/metadata` or `PATCH /connection/:connectionId/metadata` endpoints, you should migrate to `/connections/metadata`
  - If you specifically use the `POST /connection` endpoint to import connections, check the migration section below.


  ### Migrating to `POST /connections`

  Only this endpoint requires a manual migration.
  Previously, the credentials were all at the root of the body.
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.nango.dev/v1/connection \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-secret-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider_config_key": "slack",
    "access_token": "some-access-token",
    [...]
  }'
  ```

  Now they are nested under the `credentials` key:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.nango.dev/v1/connections \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-secret-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider_config_key": "slack",
    "credentials": {
      "type": "OAUTH2",
      "access_token": "some-access-token",
      [...]
    }
  }'
  ```

  Please report any inconsistencies or issues with the new endpoints to support@nango.dev or in our slack community.
