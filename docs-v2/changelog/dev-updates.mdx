<Update label="September 2025" description="Action output limit" tags={["Breaking changes"]}>

  ## Action payload out limit

  Nango actions currently have a documented output limit of 10MB. We are further restricting that limit
  to 2MB. Instead of using an action for large payloads like this, we encourage usage of the Nango [proxy](https://docs.nango.dev/guides/proxy-requests#proxy-requests).

  Additionally, we will also soon restrict action inputs so please take note of your inputs.

  ### üóìÔ∏è Timeline

  - **August 22, 2025**: [Warning](https://nango-community.slack.com/archives/C08C5US2ESZ/p1755870254146119) to users in a general announcement to the [#dev-updates](https://nango-community.slack.com/archives/C08C5US2ESZ) channel in Slack.
  - **September 26, 2025**: We will throw an error when an action output exceeds the stated limitation of 2MB.

  ### üßê Am I impacted?

  - If you use actions and have a heavy output from the action. Typically the actions that have a large output are [`fetch-attachment`](https://github.com/NangoHQ/integration-templates/blob/main/integrations/outlook/actions/fetch-attachment.ts), [`fetch-call-transcripts`](https://github.com/NangoHQ/integration-templates/blob/main/integrations/gong/actions/fetch-call-transcripts.ts) and in general any fetching any object from an external system. We have added dedicated proxy code for such operations to help with the migration: [`fetch-document`](https://github.com/NangoHQ/integration-templates/blob/main/integrations/google-drive/proxy/fetch-document.ts), [`fetch-spreadsheet`](https://github.com/NangoHQ/integration-templates/blob/main/integrations/google-sheet/proxy/fetch-spreadsheet.ts), [`fetch-file`](https://github.com/NangoHQ/integration-templates/blob/main/integrations/box/proxy/fetch-file.ts), [`fetch-database`](https://github.com/NangoHQ/integration-templates/blob/main/integrations/notion/proxy/fetch-database.ts)
  - If you're using a now deprecated prebuilt template that fetches objects from an external system

  ### üí° What should I do?

  - Check your action logs for a warning that you've exceeded the action output limitation.
  - Verify the actions you're using and log the output size of the action
  - Migrate the action to use the proxy instead

  If your action logs exceed the 2MB limitation you'll now see a warning like this

<Update label="August 2025" description="v0.66.2" tags={["Breaking changes"]}>

  ## August 2025 API Breaking changes

  In this release, we've made some changes to the API that are breaking for some users.

  - All endpoints under `/connection` are now deprecated. Use the new `/connections` endpoint instead.
  They all, except one, take and return the same data. Only the base path has changed.

  - The endpoint `POST /connections` (previously `POST /connection`) now takes a different body, but returns the same data as previously.
  This new body is more flexible and ensure stricter typings on your side and validation on our side.

  - The endpoint `POST /connection/:connectionId/metadata` and `PATCH /connection/:connectionId/metadata` who have been deprecated for a while will not be migrated to /connections and will be removed at the end of the grace period.

  ### üóìÔ∏è Timeline

  - **August 20, 2025**: We will start deprecating the `/connection` endpoints.
  - **January 20, 2026**: All `/connection` endpoints will be removed.

  ### üßê Am I impacted?

  - If you manually use any endpoint under `/connection`
  - If you use the CLI
  - If you use the official Nango SDKs

  ### üí° What should I do?

  - If you use the CLI, you should upgrade to `>=0.67.0`
  - If you use the official Nango SDKs, you should upgrade to `>=0.67.0`
  - If you manually use any endpoint under `/connection`, you should migrate to `/connections`
  - If you use the `POST /connection/:connectionId/metadata` or `PATCH /connection/:connectionId/metadata` endpoints, you should migrate to `/connections/metadata`
  - If you specifically use the `POST /connection` endpoint to import connections, check the migration section below.


  ### Migrating to `POST /connections`

  Only this endpoint requires a manual migration.
  Previously, the credentials were all at the root of the body.
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.nango.dev/v1/connection \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-secret-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider_config_key": "slack",
    "access_token": "some-access-token",
    [...]
  }'
  ```

  Now they are nested under the `credentials` key:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.nango.dev/v1/connections \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-secret-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider_config_key": "slack",
    "credentials": {
      "type": "OAUTH2",
      "access_token": "some-access-token",
      [...]
    }
  }'
  ```

  Please report any inconsistencies or issues with the new endpoints to support@nango.dev or in our slack community.
