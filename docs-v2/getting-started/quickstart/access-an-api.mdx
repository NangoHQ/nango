<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an integration">
    Sign up for a Nango account (free, no credit card):
    [![Try Nango Cloud](/images/nango-deploy-button.svg)](https://app.nango.dev/signup)

    Go to the [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) tab, click  _Configure New Integration_ and select the API to integrate with.

    APIs have different ways to authorize requests: OAuth, API key, Basic, custom. Nango abstracts away the difficulties of working with each one.

    <Accordion title="‚ö†Ô∏è Required for OAuth APIs">
        OAuth APIs require you to register your OAuth application on their developer portal.

        When registering, the API provider will prompt you for the `Callback URL`. Use the URL displayed in the Nango integration settings. Remember to register the required scopes in the Nango integration settings and, if necessary, with the API provider.

        Collect your OAuth app's `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from the API portal and input them in your Nango integration settings.
    </Accordion>

    <Tip>
        Each API has a dedicated Nango documentation page with useful links, gotchas, etc.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize your external account">
    If you don't have one already, create a test account for the external system you want to integrate with.

    On the Nango [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) tab, click _Add Test Connection_ to test the authorization flow. Pick an integration, click _Authorize_ and enter your test account credentials to authorize the API.

    Once authorized, go to the [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) tab to see the newly created connection. The "Authorization" sub-tab contains the credentials necessary to consume the external API. These credentials are securely stored and automatically refreshed by Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access the external API">
    Let's make an API request to the external API. 

    You will need to copy/paste the following values in the code snippet below: 
    - **Nango secret key** from your [Environment Settings](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings)
    - **Integration ID** from your [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations)
    - **Connection ID** from your [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections)
    <Tabs>
        <Tab title="Node">

        Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

        ```typescript
        import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

        const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

        const res = await nango.post({
            endpoint: '/external-endpoint',
            providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
            connectionId: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
            data: { "key": "value" }
        });

        console.log(res.data);
        ```
        </Tab>

        <Tab title="cURL">

        ```bash
        curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' \
        -H 'Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>' \
        -H 'Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>' \
        -d '{"key: "value"}' \
        'https://api.nango.dev/proxy/<API-ENDPOINT>'
        ```

        </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Tip>
        Alternatively, you can fetch credentials from Nango on-the-fly and make API requests without using Nango as a proxy ([Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) / [API](/reference/api/connection/get))
    </Tip>

Congrats üéâ You can now make authorized requests to the external API! Inspect the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango for details on the requests you made.
