## Nango helps you build integrations faster

Product integrations are a build vs. buy decision for engineering teams.

You can either **buy pre-built integrations** that work out of the box (unified APIs, embedded iPaaS).

Or you can **build your own integrations** in-house to match exactly what your product and users need.

Nango helps teams that want to **build integrations** do this faster and with less maintenance. It takes care of the infrastructure and grunt work needed to ship reliable, scalable integrations fast.

If you want plug-and-play integrations, we might not be the right tool for you.

## Why we think engineering teams should build their own integrations

Fundamentally, integrations map two products together:
- Salesforce has Leads, Contacts, and Accounts
- Your product may have Contacts, Vendors, and customers

How you should map these together depends on how you treat each of these objects in your code, and what your users would intuitively see as the "correct mapping".

This is not just entity or field level mapping: You might want to import Leads from Salesforce as Contacts with "type: prospect", but only if certain conditions on Leads are true.

When you buy a pre-built integration, somebody else has done this mapping for you. In our experience, it's impossible to create a good mapping, unless you have a deep understanding of both products you are mapping together.

Last but not least, you don't control pre-built integrations.  
You cannot change the API requests they make, change transformations, or access detailed debugging information. Issues will come up in production. With pre-built integrations, you are at the mercy of your provider's support team to debug and prioritize your requests over their other customers.

Many successful SaaS & AI companies agree with us:
- OpenAI builds all integrations in-house
- HubSpot builds all critical integrations in-house, despite a huge marketplace of others building towards them
- Deel has an entire engineering team focused on building best-in-class integrations
- Linear builds all integrations in-house
