Nango is the platform to **authorize and access APIs** on behalf of your customers.

## Who is Nango for?

Nango is designed for developers building **product integrations**: Letting users connect their external accounts to your own product.

## Core features

- **[API Auth](/guides/use-cases/api-auth)** for [500+ APIs](/integrations/overview)
    - **Embedded, white-label auth UI**: With appropriate input forms and guidance.
    - **Secure credential management**: Retrieval, storage, and refreshing of API credentials.
    - **Credential monitoring**: Notifies via webhooks when credentials become invalid.
- **[Request proxying](/guides/use-cases/proxy)**: Injects credentials into API requests seamlessly.
- **[Data Syncing](/guides/use-cases/syncs)**: Continuously synchronize data from APIs to your application.
- **[Actions](/guides/use-cases/actions)**: Encapsulate use cases into reusable actions.
- **[Webhooks](/guides/use-cases/webhooks)**: Listen to webhooks from APIs with a universal interface.
- **[MCP](/guides/use-cases/mcp-server)**: Expose your integrations as an MCP server for tool calling.
- **[Observability](/guides/platform/logs)**: Tailored monitoring for integrations.
- **Management dashboard & APIs**: Control and oversee all connected accounts.

## Benefits

- **Speed**: Eliminates the need to build authorization flows and infrastructure for each API.
- **Reliability**: Provides a robust solution from day one.
- **Security**: Ensures secure storage and retrieval of API credentials & user data.
- **Observability**: Provides full visibility into every interaction with the external API.
- **Modularity**: Pick the features you want to use, without vendor lock-in.

By leveraging Nango, developers can save days per integration and months over time.

## Build vs. buy for product integrations

Should you build your own product integrations, or buy pre-built connectors?

We believe **engineering teams should build their own integrations** (with a platform like Nango).

### The case for building integrations

Every product has unique data structures and user workflows. When you build an integration, you map your product and the external product together. Getting the details right is crucial.

Pre-built integrations force you into someone else's assumptions about how your data should connect, which often doesn't match your users' expectations or your product's logic.

### The Control and Reliability Advantage

When you build integrations in-house, you maintain full control over API requests, data transformations, and debugging capabilities. With pre-built solutions, you're dependent on external support teams to fix issues and prioritize your requests, which can lead to delays and frustration when problems arise in production.
