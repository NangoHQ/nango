## When should you use _syncs_? 

_Syncs_ enable to continuously sync data between your app and external APIs. Use them to:
- keep a list of records in sync between your app and an external system
- take action when records from an external system are created, updated and/or deleted 

_Syncs_ handle:
- Efficient API requests and data transformations.
- Unified data schemas across diverse external APIs.
- Advanced job orchestration through the dashboard & API.
- Automated rate-limit handling and retries.
- Built-in pagination.
- Data integrity, deduplication, and change detection.
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring.

# Step 0: API authorization

Start by ensuring the external API you intend to work with is authorized. If not, refer to the [Authorize APIs guide](/guides/oauth) for guidance.

# Step 1: Activate a pre-built _sync_

Go to the [Syncs & Actions tab](https://app.nango.dev/syncs) and click the `Add New` button.

</Frame>

From the `Provider` dropdown, select the desired API. In the `Template` dropdown, pick the _sync_ that correspond to the object(s) you want to synchronize. Click `Add Sync` at the page's bottom.

Fantastic! Nango will now automatically sync these objects in the background.

# Step 2: Fetch the synced data

Fetch the synced data

Transition to the [Project Settings tab](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings) to obtain the secret key essential for fetching the synced data:

Now, collect the continually updated data:

<Tab title="cURL">

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.nango.dev/records?model=<MODEL-NAME>' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <PROJECT-SECRET-KEY>' \
  --header 'Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>' \
  --header 'Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>'
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Node SDK">

```ts
import { Nango }  from '@nangohq/node';

const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<PROJECT-SECRET-KEY>' });

const result = await nango.listRecords({
    providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
    connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>',
    model: '<MODEL-NAME>'
});
```
</Tab>


</Tabs>

Nango also sends [webhooks](/guides/webhooks) whenever new/updated/deleted records are detected. That's it 🎉
