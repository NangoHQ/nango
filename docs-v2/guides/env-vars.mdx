## When should you use script environment variables?

Script environment variables are useful when you need to access sensitive credentials in your _syncs_ or _actions_, that is not specific to a specific _connection_. 

For example, if you have a Discord integration with a bot token, it will need to be used every time you want to send a Discord message, no matter for which _connection_. In this case, you can create an environment variable for this token and access it from your Discord _syncs_ and _actions_. 

## How can I use script environment variables?

Navigate to your "Project Settings" in your [dashboard](https://app.nango.dev) and add/edit the 'Environment Variables' section.

Once set, the environment variables will be accessible from your _sync_ and _action_ scripts.

Secrets are specific to your environment, so can have different secrets with the same name for your `dev` and `prod` environments.
