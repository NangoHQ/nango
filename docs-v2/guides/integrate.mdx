</Frame>

## 1. Get user permission from your site

Integrate the Nango frontend SDK into your application to get user permission to access their data.

Store `connectionId` & `integrationId` in your database. You'll need these to get data later.

```ts Frontend: Trigger the OAuth flow.
const integrationId = 'zendesk';
const connectionId = 'user123';

const result = await nango.auth(integrationId, connectionId);

if (result.ok) {
    saveToDatabase(connectionId, integrationId);
}
```

## 2. Get data update notifications

Nango will alert you (via a webhook) when there's new data to fetch.

You choose how often to check for data updates. Nango will only alert you when there are actual changes.

Key fields in the webhook payload, essential for later data retrieval:

- `connectionId` : The specific end-user related to the data.
- `model` : The data model for which new data is available.
- `queryTimeStamp`: Timestamp to locate recent modifications.

```json Backend: Receive this webhook payload.
{
    "connectionId": "user123",
    "model": "ticket",
    "providerConfigKey": "zendesk",
    "responseResults": { "ticket": { "added": 2, "updated": 6, "deleted": 0 } },
    "queryTimeStamp": "2023-05-31T11:46:13.390Z"
}
```

## 3. Collect and save the new data

When you receive the webhook, fetch the most recent data from Nango using the backend SDK or API.

This data will be in the format you've chosen. It can even be standardized across different APIs.

You can directly save this data to your database.

```ts Backend: Fetch & save new records.
const records = await nango.getRecords<Ticket>({
    providerConfigKey: 'zendesk',
    connectionId: 'user123',
    model: 'ticket',
    delta: queryTimeStamp
});

saveToDatabase(records);
```

## 4. Write back to external APIs

Push updates back to external APIs in a way that is:

- **Synchronous:** Have your changes immediately reflected.
- **Unified:** Benefit from standardized schemas across different APIs.
- **Customizable:** Support intricate workflows and combined API calls.

```ts Backend: Write back to external APIs.
const result = await nango.triggerAction({
    providerConfigKey: 'zendesk',
    connectionId: 'user123',
    action: 'create-ticket',
    input: { "title": "...", "content": "..." }
});
```
