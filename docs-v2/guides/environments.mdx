Nango supports multiple cloud environments, enabling safe development and testing of integrations before they go live. This system ensures that your work can move smoothly from development to production.

# Shared workspace environments

All environments within a workspace are shared among team members. Any changes you make—whether to environment settings, connections, integrations, or integration scripts—will reflect across your team. 

<Info>
We're working on introducing personal development environments to facilitate individual testing and development. Until then, the [dry run feature](/guides/custom-integrations/overview#test-your-scripts-locally) in the CLI is your go-to for local integration testing.
</Info>

Access different environments directly from the Nango UI. The left navigation bar lets you easily switch between them.

# Environment-specific settings

Each environment in Nango comes with its own set of configurations:

- API & SDK Keys: Unique public and secret keys for interacting with the Nango API and SDKs.
- Callback URL: For completing OAuth authentication flows.
- Webhook URL: To receive webhooks from Nango.
- Environment Variables: For custom configuration needs.

These environment-specific settings ensure your integrations can operate under different conditions without conflict.

# Default and additional environments

By default, Nango provides two environments: Development (Dev) and Production (Prod). Paid users can add up to 10 environments from the Nango UI, and more by reaching out to us.
