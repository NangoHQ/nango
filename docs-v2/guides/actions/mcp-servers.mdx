# MCP Server

The Nango MCP server allows [actions](/guides/actions/overview) to be used as tools by LLMs.

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. It follows a client-server architecture where:

- **MCP Hosts/Clients**: Applications like Claude Desktop or AI tools that access data through MCP
- **MCP Servers**: Programs that expose specific capabilities through the standardized protocol
- **Data Sources**: External systems and services that MCP servers can connect to (in Nango's case, API integrations)

Nango's MCP server implementation allows your LLMs to interact with external APIs via your existing Nango connections and actions.

## How it works

MCP servers expose your Nango actions as tools that can be invoked by LLM clients. When an LLM client connects to your MCP server:

1. The server authenticates the request using your secret key
2. It identifies available actions based on the provided connection ID and provider config key
3. It exposes these actions as tools for the LLM to invoke
4. When the LLM invokes a tool, the MCP server executes the corresponding Nango action

## Connecting to the Nango MCP server

To connect an LLM client to your MCP server, you'll need:

- A Nango secret key for authentication
- A valid connection ID that determines available actions
- An MCP client that supports the Streamable HTTP transport

The Nango MCP server is exposed at `https://api.nango.dev/mcp`.

Here's an example using [Vercel's AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction) with the MCP client:
```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp.js";
import { experimental_createMCPClient, generateText } from "ai";

const mcpClient = await experimental_createMCPClient({
  transport: new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(new URL('https://api.nango.dev/mcp'), {
    requestInit: {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer <secret-key>',
        'connection-id': '<connection-id>',
        'provider-config-key': '<provider-config-key>'
      }
    },
  }),
});

const { text, toolCalls } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
  tools: await mcpClient.tools(),
  maxSteps: 5,
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'Schedule a meeting with John Doe',
    },
  ],
});
```

## Authentication

Requests to the MCP server must include the following headers:

- `Authorization`: Bearer token with your Nango secret key
- `connection-id`: The connection ID that determines available actions
- `provider-config-key`: The provider unique identifier
