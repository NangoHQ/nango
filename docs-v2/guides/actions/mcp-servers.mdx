## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. It follows a client-server architecture where:

- **MCP Hosts/Clients**: Applications like Claude Desktop or AI tools that access data through MCP
- **MCP Servers**: Programs that expose specific capabilities through the standardized protocol
- **Data Sources**: External systems and services that MCP servers can connect to (in Nango's case, API integrations)

Nango's MCP server implementation allows your LLMs to interact with external APIs via your existing Nango connections and actions.

## How it works

MCP servers expose your Nango actions as tools that can be invoked by LLM clients. When an LLM client connects to your MCP server:

1. The server authenticates the request using your secret key
2. It identifies available actions based on the provided connection ID and provider config key
3. It exposes these actions as tools for the LLM to invoke
4. When the LLM invokes a tool, the MCP server executes the corresponding Nango action

## Authentication

Requests to the MCP server must include the following headers:

- `Authorization`: Bearer token with your Nango secret key
- `connection-id`: The connection ID that determines available actions
- `provider-config-key`: The provider unique identifier

## Connecting to the Nango MCP server

The Nango MCP server is exposed at `https://api.nango.dev/mcp` and supports the [Streamable HTTP transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http). The **HTTP+SSE** transport is **NOT** supported, as it's being deprecated.

### Programmatically with the Vercel AI SDK


Here's an example of connecting to the Nango MCP server using [Vercel's AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction):
```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp.js";
import { experimental_createMCPClient, generateText } from "ai";

const mcpClient = await experimental_createMCPClient({
  transport: new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(new URL('https://api.nango.dev/mcp'), {
    requestInit: {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer <secret-key>',
        'connection-id': '<connection-id>',
        'provider-config-key': '<provider-config-key>'
      }
    },
  }),
});

const { text, toolCalls } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
  tools: await mcpClient.tools(), // You can add tools from multiple connections
  maxSteps: 5,
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'Schedule a meeting with John Doe',
    },
  ],
});
```

### Claude for Desktop

A good way to manually test the MCP server is to use [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) paired with the [mcp-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) npm package.

Claude Desktop originally only supports the [sdio](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports#stdio) transport, but the `mcp-remote` package allows you to proxy requests to the MCP server over the Streamable HTTP transport.

1. Install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
2. Open `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (MacOS) or `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows) in a code editor and add your desired MCP server connections using [mcp-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote). Eg:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "nango-google-drive": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "mcp-remote",
            "https://api.nango.dev/mcp",
            "--header",
            "Authorization:Bearer <secret-key>",
            "--header",
            "provider-config-key:google-drive",
            "--header",
            "connection-id:<connection-id>"
          ]
        },
        "nango-slack": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "mcp-remote",
            "https://api.nango.dev/mcp",
            "--header",
            "Authorization:Bearer <secret-key>",
            "--header",
            "provider-config-key:slack",
            "--header",
            "connection-id:<connection-id>"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    > Avoid modifying the spacing on the headers as `mcp-remote` is sensitive to it.
3. Restart Claude Desktop to apply the changes.
4. Claude should now be able to list and execute actions from the connections you added to the config file.
