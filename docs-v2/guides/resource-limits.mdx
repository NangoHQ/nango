# Free plan limits

1. **Connections:** Limited to 1,000 per account.
2. **Integration endpoints:** Deactivated after 14 days of inactivity. You can manually reactivate them in the Nango UI.

<Note>
**Why these limits exist**

Each connection stores API credentials that are periodically refreshed, verified and logged. These credentials are accessible via Nangoâ€™s API and may be queried frequently.

Each integration endpoint runs on a customer-specific VM. Keeping these VMs active indefinitely is not feasible for free-tier accounts due to infrastructure costs.
</Note>

# Global limits
