# Free plan limits

### Authorization-related features

- Up to 1,000 connections across all environments.

### Integration endpoints & scripts

- This feature is gated behind a 14-day trial
- Trials can be extended indefinitely via the Nango UI (14 days at a time) 
- Integrations using integration endpoints/scripts are limited to 50 connections

<Note>
**Why is there a trial for integraiton endpoints & scripts**

Integration endpoints and scripts run in isolated virtual machines to ensure reliable and secure execution. Many free accounts become inactive and the trial system helps us reclaim unused virtual machines.

# Global limits

### API rate-limit

- 2,400 requests per minute across all usage (app and integration scripts).
- If the limit is exceeded, use the standard rate-limit headers to determine when to resume requests.
- Higher limits are available for Scale customers.

### Integration scripts

Integrations have the following limits: 

| Script Type | Max execution time | Max enqueuing time |
