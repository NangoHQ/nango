<Info>
    Pre-requisites: 
    - Configure webhooks in the external API portal ([details](/guides/webhooks/webhooks-from-apis/overview#pre-requisite-configure-webhooks-in-the-external-api-portal))
    - Ensure you receive [webhooks from Nango](/guides/webhooks/webhooks-from-nango#webhook-settings)
</Info>

Nango will automatically forwards all webhooks from [supported APIs](/guides/webhooks/webhooks-from-apis/overview#supported-apis) to your app.

Nango webhook forwards are POST requests with the following JSON body:
```json
{
   "from": "hubspot",
   "type": "forward",
   "connectionId": "<CONNECTION-ID>",
   "providerConfigKey": "<INTEGRATION-ID>",
   "payload": ... // Raw payload from Hubspot wehook
}
```

External webhook forwarding can be disabled from the _Environment Settings_ tab.
