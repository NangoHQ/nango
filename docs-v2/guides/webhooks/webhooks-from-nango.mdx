# Overview

Nango sends webhook notifications to your backend in different cases:
- **Sync webhook**: new data from syncs is available ([guide](/guides/syncs/use-a-sync#listen-for-webhooks-from-nango))
- **Authorization webhook**: an authorization flow completes ([guide](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui#3-listen-for-webhoooks-and-save-the-connection-id-backend))
- **External API webhook forwarding**: an external API webhook is forwarded to your app ([guide](/guides/webhooks/webhooks-from-apis#forward-external-webhooks-to-your-app))

# Webhook settings

Settings related to Nango webhooks can be found in the _Environment Settings_ tab of the Nango UI. It lets you specify webhook URLs as well as the types of webhooks you wish to receive.

<Warning>
New Nango webhook types are added regularly, without considering this a breaking change. Your webhook handling logic should gracefully support receiving new types of webhooks by simply ignoring them.
</Warning>

# Types of Nango webhooks

Webhooks from Nango are POST requests. Nango sends multiple types of webhooks to your backend. All webhook types are sent to the same URL(s) configured in your _Environment Settings_. 

Webhook type definitions can be found [here](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/blob/master/packages/types/lib/webhooks/api.ts).

### Auth webhooks

New connection webhooks have `"type": "auth"` and `"operation": "creation"`. They are sent after a connection has been successfully created. 

Payload received following a connection creation: 
```json
{
    "type": "auth",
    "operation": "creation",
    "connectionId": "<your-connection-id>",
    "authMode": "OAUTH2 | BASIC | API_KEY | ...",
    "providerConfigKey": "<your-integration-id>",
    "provider": "<your-provider-key>",
    "environment": "DEV | PROD | ...",
    "success": true,
    "endUser": { 
        "endUserId": "<your-end-user-id>", 
        "organizationId": "<your-organization-id>"
    }
}
```

<Warning>
Processing webhooks with `"type": "auth"` and `"operation": "creation"` is **necessary**. After a connection is created, these webhooks give you the generated connection ID which lets you access the connection later on. 

Use the values of `endUser.endUserId` (and optionally `endUser.organizationId`) to reconcile and save the connection ID with the user/org who initiated the connection.
</Warning>

All `authMode` values can be found [here](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/blob/master/packages/types/lib/auth/api.ts). The `authMode` value depends on the `provider` value.

All `operation` values are: 
- `creation`: a new connection has been created
- `override`: a connection has been re-authorized
- `refresh`: an OAuth connection's access token has been refreshed

Payload received following a refresh token error: 
```json
{
    "type": "auth",
    "operation": "refresh",
    "connectionId": "<your-connection-id>",
    "authMode": "OAUTH2 | BASIC | API_KEY | ...",
    "providerConfigKey": "<your-integration-id>",
    "provider": "<your-provider-key>",
    "environment": "DEV | PROD | ...",
    "success": false,
    "endUser": { 
        "endUserId": "<your-end-user-id>", 
        "organizationId": "<your-organization-id>"
    },
    "error": {
        "type": "<string>",
        "description": "<string>"
    }
}
```


<Note>
Webhooks are only sent for certain connection creation errors. For example, during the OAuth flow, some errors are reported locally in the OAuth modal by the external API. Since Nango does not receive these errors, it cannot trigger a webhook for them.
</Note>

### Sync webhooks

Sync webhooks are sent when a [sync](/guides/syncs/overview) execution finishes, whether successful or not.

Payload received following a successful sync execution: 
```json
{
    "type": "sync",
    "connectionId": "<your-connection-id>",
    "providerConfigKey": "<your-integration-id>",
    "syncName": "<your-sync-script-name>",
    "model": "<your-model-name>",
    "syncType": "INCREMENTAL | INITIAL | WEBHOOK",
    "success": true,
    "modifiedAfter": "<timestamp>",
    "responseResults": {
        "added": number,
        "updated": number,
        "deleted": number
    }
}
```

By default, Nango sends a webhook even if no modified data was detected in the last sync execution (referred as an "empty" sync), but this is configurable in your _Environment Settings_. In case of an empty sync, the `responseResults` would be: 
```json
[
    "added": 0,
    "updated": 0,
    "deleted": 0
  ]
```

The `syncType` possible values are:
- `INITIAL`: for the very first execution of a sync.
- `INCREMENTAL`: for subsequent executions  of a sync.
- `WEBHOOK`: when an external API webhooks triggers the execution of the sync's `onWebhookPayloadReceived` function.

Payload received following a failed sync execution: 
```json
{
    "type": "sync",
    "connectionId": "<your-connection-id>",
    "providerConfigKey": "<your-integration-id>",
    "syncName": "<your-sync-script-name>",
    "model": "<your-model-name>",
    "syncType": "INCREMENTAL | INITIAL | WEBHOOK",
    "success": true,
    "error": {
        "type": "<string>",
        "description": "<string>"
    },
    "startedAt": "<timestamp>",
    "failedAt": "<timestamp>"
}
```

### External webhook forwarding

Nango can forward webhooks received from 3rd-party APIs. See details in this [guide](/guides/webhooks/webhooks-from-apis#forward-external-webhooks-to-your-app).

# Webhook retries

Nango retries each webhook with non-2xx responses 7 times with exponential backoff (starting delay: 100ms, time multiple: 2, view details in the [code](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/blob/master/packages/webhooks/lib/utils.ts)).

Each webhook attempt is logged in the _Logs_ tab. You can also use the [OpenTelemetry exporter](/guides/logs/opentelemetry-exporter) to monitor Nango webhooks in your own observability stack.

# Webhook verification

Validate webhook provenance by looking at the `X-Nango-Signature` header.

It's a SHA-256 hash generated using the secret key found in the _Environment Settings_ in the Nango UI.

The webhook signature can be generated with the following code:

<Tab title="Node SDK">

```

Only accept a webhook if the `X-Nango-Signature` header value matches the webhook signature.
