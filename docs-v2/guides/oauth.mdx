## Step 1: Set up Nango

Create a free Nango account (no credit card required):
[![Try Nango Cloud](/images/nango-deploy-button.svg)](https://app.nango.dev/signup)

Open the [Dashboard](https://app.nango.dev) in your browser.

## Step 2: Create an _integration_

On the Dashboard, go to the New [Integration page](https://app.nango.dev/integration/create) and fill in the form.

To get the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` you will need to register your app with the API. The API provider will ask you to submit the `Callback URL` shown at the bottom of the New Integration page on Nango. You should also register the necessary scopes both with the API provider and on the New Integration page on Nango. 

<Tip>
    Search for your API here on the Nango docs: e.g. [Notion](/integrations/all/notion).  
    It will show you helpful links to register your OAuth app & get scopes.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Test your _integration_

Click "OAuth" next to the integration to try an OAuth flow from Nango.

- If you get an error check the [Activity tab](https://app.nango.dev/activity): The logs there can show you helpful information to debug the issue.
- If the OAuth flow succeeds, you can get your access token from the [Connections tab](https://app.nango.dev/connections) - Congrats! 🎉

## Step 4: Embed Nango in your frontend

Install `@nangohq/frontend` and use the code snippet from the [Add New Connection page](https://app.nango.dev/connections/create) (step 3 above) to trigger OAuth flows from your frontend (cf. [Frontend SDK docs](/sdks/frontend)).

`<CONNECTION-ID>` identifies this user's connection with the _integration_ in Nango. We recommend using a user ID or similar for it.

## Step 5: Retrieve access tokens
In your backend you can use our [Node SDK](/sdks/node) or [Connections REST API](/api-reference/connection/get) to fetch always-fresh access tokens (which will allow you to query the external API).

-   `<INTEGRATION-ID>` is the name of your integration. It is listed on the [Integrations tab](https://app.nango.dev/integrations) in the Dashboard, e.g. `slack`
-   `<CONNECTION-ID>` is the Connection ID you passed in step 4 above.

<Tip>
    When you fetch access tokens from Nango, Nango refreshes them if necessary. Always fetch them **fresh** to make sure you never work with an expired access token!
</Tip>

### With the backend Node SDK

Check the [backend Node SDK reference](/sdks/node) for more details.

Install `@nangohq/node`, then use:

```ts
import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

let nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<SECRET-KEY>' });

let creds = await nango.getToken('<INTEGRATION-ID>', '<CONNECTION-ID>');
```

### With the REST API

Check the [API reference](/api-reference/connection/get) for full details and an example response

Get the `Secret Key` from the [Project Settings page](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings).

```bash
curl --request GET \
        --url https://api.nango.dev/connection/<CONNECTION-ID>?provider_config_key=<INTEGRATION-ID> \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <SECRET-KEY-FROM-PROJECT-SETTINGS>'
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Callback URL

You can change the callback URL of Nango if you want to personalize it (e.g. use your own domain).

If you are using Nango Cloud, follow these steps:

1. Add a new endpoint in your app, e.g. `https://EXAMPLE.com/oauth-callback`. All requests to this endpoint should redirect to `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` and **pass along all original parameters**. The easiest way to do this is with a 308 redirect.
2. Change the registered OAuth callback URL with all API providers. Otherwise they will refuse new flows!
3. When you are ready change your Nango callback URL in the Project Settings page ([cloud](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings))

<Warning>
Before saving the custom callback URL in Nango, ensure that:

-   the callback URL redirects to `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` and passes along all parameters (e.g. 308 redirect)
-   your OAuth app, as registered with the external API provider, has the new callback URL whitelisted

</Warning>

If you are self-hosting Nango, follow the instructions [here](/self-host/instructions) to change your callback URL.

### Connection Configuration

Some API Providers require connection-specific configuration variables (e.g. Zendesk, Shopify, Qualtrics, Contentstack).

For example, Zendesk has the following authorization URL, where the subdomain is specific to a user's Zendesk account:

```
https://<USER-SUBDOMAIN>.zendesk.com/oauth/authorizations/new
```

To specify the subdomain, pass in an additional configuration object to `nango.auth()`:

```typescript
nango.auth('zendesk', '<CONNECTION-ID>', { params: { subdomain: '<ZENDESK-SUBDOMAIN>' } });
```

You can find which configuration parameters are necessary for your [Connection](/core-concepts#connections) in the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) file.

### Connection-Specific Authorization Params

Some APIs require to pass additional query parameters in the authorization URL. If this applies to all users & use-cases, these params can be added to the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) _API configurations_. 

But sometimes, the additional authorization parameter is specific to a user or a use-case. In this case, it is possible to add it to the `nango.auth()` call from the Frontend SDK:

```typescript
nango.auth('discord', '<CONNECTION-ID>', { authorization_params: { key: 'value' } });
```

### Connection Metadata

During the OAuth flow, certain APIs return important metadata in addition to credentials (e.g. a company ID, tenant ID, instance URL, etc).

To see if Nango stores metadata for a specific API check the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) and look for the `metadata` property.

Nango stores this metadata in the [Connection](/core-concepts#connections) objects. You can retrieve it with the [SDKs](/sdks) or [REST API](/api-reference).

### Securing the Frontend SDK calls with HMAC

By default, this feature is disabled and your frontend can attempt to create a new _connection_ using any Integration ID and Connection ID.

But you might want to ensure that the app user is the only one that can create a new connection with that Connection ID.

Enable the HMAC feature in the [Project Settings tab](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings). 

Once enabled, Nango will require an HMAC digest for every attempt to create a new _connection_ from your frontend.

The HMAC digest is generated by your backend using a key and the combination of the **Integration ID** and the **Connection ID**. Your backend should keep the key private and not reveal it to your frontend or end-users.

Your frontend passes the HMAC digest as follows:

```ts
nango.auth('<INTEGRATION-ID>', '<CONNECTION-ID>', { hmac: '<HMAC-DIGEST>' });
```

The HMAC digest can be generated by using the following code in your backend:

```js
import * as crypto from 'node:crypto';

// TODO: execute authentication and authorization checks before generating the HMAC digest.

// The default value for '<HMAC-ALGORITHM>' is 'sha256'.
// The value of '<HMAC-KEY>' should match the HMAC key passed to the Nango server.
const hmac = crypto.createHmac('<HMAC-ALGORITHM>', '<HMAC-KEY>');
hmac.update('<INTEGRATION-ID>:<CONNECTION-ID>');
const digest = hmac.digest('hex');

// TODO: return the value of `digest` to the frontend to pass to `nango.auth`.
```

### Configure Integrations Programmatically

Nango offers a [REST API](/api-reference/integration/list) to programmatically manage your [Integrations](/core-concepts#integrations).
