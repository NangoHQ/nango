Nango publishes [pre-built integrations](/guides/pre-built-integrations/overview) for the most popular APIs & use cases. Pre-built integrations are a starting point for your custom integrations to reuse and extend.

Here is the [list of publicly available pre-built integrations](https://www.nango.dev/templates).

If you want to edit their code or configuration, you must pull them in your integration folder.

<Info>
Pre-requisite: set up [the CLI and integration folder](/guides/custom-integrations/build-a-custom-integration#set-up-the-nango-cli-and-integration-folder).
</Info>

# Download the template code

Download the template code locally. The code is available on [GitHub](https://www.nango.dev/templates) or directly in the Nango UI in the _Endpoints_ tab of an integration.

# Copy/paste the integration configuration & scripts

Copy/paste the necessary configuration from the `nango.yaml` file of the template folder into your own `nango.yaml` configuration (in your `nango-integrations` folder).

Copy/paste the necessary integration script files (ending in `.ts`) from the template folder into your `nango-integrations` folder.

There is no need to copy/paste the `models.ts` file from the template folder; it is a generated file that will be regenerated separately in your integrations folder when you run `nango dev`.

# Customize the template at will

Edit the `nango.yaml` configuration and integration scripts as you see fit ([guide](/guides/custom-integrations/build-a-custom-integration#write-an-integration-script)).

<Info>
If a custom integration script name conflicts with a template name, the custom integration script will override the template in the Nango UI (once you deploy your custom integrations to Nango).
