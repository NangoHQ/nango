Building custom integrations for Nango is much faster when using AI tools. This guide shows you how to leverage Cursor or Claude Code to build high-quality integrations quickly.

## Overview of recommended tools

We recommend using one of these AI-powered development environments:

- **Cursor** with Agent Mode
- **Claude Code** (Anthropic's official CLI tool)

Both tools understand Nango's architecture and can help you build integrations following best practices.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. **Working Nango integrations folder**: Either an existing `nango-integrations` directory or run `nango init` to create one
2. **Environment setup**: Your `.env` file configured with development environment secret (found in [dashboard settings](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings))
3. **Provider configured**: The provider should already be configured in your [Nango dashboard](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations)
4. **Test connection**: At least one working test connection for the provider you're integrating

## Step-by-step process

### 1. Set up your development environment

First, make sure your Nango project is properly initialized:

```bash
# If you don't have a nango-integrations folder yet
nango init --ai cursor

# Navigate to your integrations directory
cd nango-integrations

# Ensure your environment is configured
# Check that .env contains your NANGO_SECRET_KEY_DEV
# Get your dev secret from: https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings
```

### 2. Craft effective prompts

When working with your AI assistant, provide clear, specific prompts:

**Example prompt structure:**
```
I need to build a Nango custom [SYNC/ACTION] for [PROVIDER_NAME] called [INTEGRATION_NAME].

## Context
- Provider: [provider-name]
- Integration: [integration-name]
- Type: [sync/action]
- Test connection ID: [connection-id]

## Additional details
- **Output schema**: [describe the expected data structure]
- **Field mapping**:
  - `api_field_name` → `nango_field_name`
  - other transformations (ex: dates)
- **API Documentation**: [link-to-docs]
- **Data source**: [specific API endpoint(s) to call]
- **Error handling requirements**

Please implement this step by step and use `nango dryrun <integration-name> <connection-id> --validation [--input '{...}']` to test.
```

### 3. Key prompt tips

- **Be specific about the provider and integration name** - this helps the AI understand the context
- **Specify sync vs action** - clearly state whether you're building a sync (continuous data synchronization) or action (one-time operation)
- **Specify data models** - clearly describe what data you want to be synced or returned and its structure
- **Include field mapping details** - specify how API fields should map to your desired output schema and any transformations needed
- **Provide the test connection ID** - enables the AI to run `nango dryrun` for testing
- **Include API documentation links** - if available, provide links to the provider's API docs

### 4. Iterative Development

Work with your AI assistant iteratively:

1. Start with basic data fetching
2. Test with `nango dryrun`
3. Add data transformation and validation
4. Implement error handling
5. Add pagination if needed
6. Final testing and cleanup

## Common pitfalls and checklist

When using AI to build integrations, watch out for these common issues:

### ❌ API Knowledge Gaps
- **Problem**: AI may not know specific API endpoints/parameters or may use non-existent endpoints
- **Solution**: Provide API documentation and verify endpoint usage against the actual API docs
- **Watch for**: Endpoints that don't exist in the provider's API, client-side filtering instead of using proper query parameters

### ❌ Code Artifacts
- **Problem**: Leftover debugging code or incomplete implementations
- **Solution**: Review generated code thoroughly and ask AI to clean up artifacts

### ❌ Missing Validation
- **Problem**: No input validation or data type checking
- **Solution**: Explicitly ask for validation of API responses and input parameters

### ❌ Poor Error Handling
- **Problem**: Basic or missing error handling for API failures or missing data
- **Solution**: Request comprehensive error handling for common API error scenarios

### ✅ Quality checklist

Before finalizing your integration, verify:

- [ ] API endpoints are correctly implemented
- [ ] Proper query parameters are used
- [ ] All debugging code and artifacts are removed
- [ ] Input and output validation is implemented
- [ ] Error handling covers common failure scenarios
- [ ] Pagination is implemented correctly
- [ ] Data models match the expected schema
- [ ] `nango dryrun` passes successfully and without errors

## When to restart with fresh context

Consider starting with a fresh AI context when:

- The conversation becomes too long and the AI loses track of requirements
- Multiple failed attempts have cluttered the context
- The AI starts suggesting irrelevant or incorrect solutions

<Tip>
Save working code snippets before restarting, so you can quickly provide context to the fresh session.
</Tip>

## Best practices for AI-assisted development

1. **Start simple**: Begin with basic functionality and iterate
2. **Test frequently**: Ensure the agent is running `nango dryrun` after each significant change
3. **Provide feedback**: Give clear feedback on what works and what doesn't
4. **Stay focused**: Keep prompts focused on specific tasks
5. **Review thoroughly**: Always review AI-generated code before deploying

By following this guide and leveraging AI assistance effectively, you can build robust Nango integrations much faster than traditional development approaches.
