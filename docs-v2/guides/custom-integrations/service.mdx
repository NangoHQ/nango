From building thousands of integrations for hundreds of companies, we've learned that most integrations are unique. Even with a robust integration infrastructure like Nango, implementing business logic for each integration can still be time-consuming.

This is where the Nango Custom Integration Service comes in—we take care of the heavy lifting for you, so you can ship integrations faster.

## How it works

You provide us with **specifications**, including the **input/output schemas** of the data you want to sync, and we handle the rest:

- **Find a test account** for the integration
- **Implement the integration(s)**, unifying schemas across APIs if needed (based on your custom schema!)
- **Test and validate** the integration
- **Maintain the integration** as APIs change

## Why this is efficient

Our deep API expertise and experience with countless use cases allow us to deliver integrations quickly and reliably:

- We know the Nango platform inside and out.
- We have deep expertise with many Enterprise APIs like Netsuite, Workday, Salesforce, etc.
- We've encountered and solved common API pitfalls before.
- We build integrations efficiently and at scale.

## How to use it

The custom integration service is available to Scale plan customers:

- Your contract must include access to the integration service.
- We agree on a monthly workload or number of integrations.
- You send integration requests via Slack, and we deliver with fast turnaround.
- Calls are scheduled when necessary to clarify requirements.

## Future plans

We are increasingly leveraging AI to make our integration service faster and more powerful:

- Automating integration code/config generation
- AI-driven code reviews and testin
- Automated issue detection and debugging
- Smarter integration maintenance

We will continue to invest in automation tooling, making it available to customers who build integrations themselves. As always, we dogfood our tooling internally before opening it up for external teams to use with enhanced workflows.
