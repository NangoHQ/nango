Nango events allow you to execute integration scripts in response to particular situations, enabling more dynamic and responsive integrations.

# Types of Nango events

Nango currently supports the following events:
- `pre-connection-creation` occurs before a connection has been created. Useful for custom credentials validation.
- `post-connection-creation` occurs when a connection has been created.
- `pre-connection-deletion` occurs before a connection is deleted.

Checkout the [reference](/reference/integration-configuration#on-events-fields) for details.

# Use cases

Event-based scripts are particularly useful for:
1. **Connection setup**. Ex:
    - Setting up webhooks with an external API.
    - Creating default resources or configurations.
2. **Cleanup operations**. Ex:
    - Removing webhooks from an external API.
    - Notifying external systems about the connection termination.
    - Cleaning up associated resources.

# Main characteristics

## Trigger
Event-based Scripts are __automatically__ triggered by Nango:
    - They execute immediately when the event occurs.
    - No manual intervention is required.
    - They cannot be scheduled or delayed.
    - Events are triggered exactly once per occurrence.
    - Their executions are logged and can be monitored.

## Constraints
Event-based scripts operate under specific __constraints__:
    - They cannot save, update or delete records.
    - They focus on side effects and external system interactions.
    - They can make API calls to external systems.
    - They can read existing connection data.
    - They can log information for monitoring.
    - They can modify external resource states.

# Event-based scripts
Event-based executions are powered by integration scripts that encapsulate the logic for interfacing with external APIs.

Event-based scripts have the following structure:

```typescript setup.ts
import { createOnEvent } from 'nango';

export default createOnEvent({
  exec: async (nango) => {
    // Your integration code goes here.
  }
});
```

To enable the above script, you create a file and import in your index.ts file:
```ts index.ts
import './airtable/on-events/pre-connection-deletion.js';
```

```ts pre-connection-deletion.ts
import { createOnEvent } from 'nango';

export default createOnEvent({
  exec: async (nango) => {
    // Your integration code goes here.
  }
});
```

The `exec` function kicks off when the event the script is associated to occurs.

Event-based scripts focus solely on immediate tasks. Calls to `nango.batchSave()`, `nango.batchUpdate()`, and `nango.batchDelete()` are not applicable. However, scripts can call actions, enabling complex workflows through the composition of multiple actions.
