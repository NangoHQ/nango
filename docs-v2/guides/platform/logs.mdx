Nango's logs are very comprehensive and give you a detailed picture of what happens in your integrations.

## Our approach

Since integrations rely on third party APIs, production issues are bound to happen.

When you encounter a problem, great observability is the difference between a week-long needle-in-a-haystack hunt, or a timely resolution.

We built Nango's logs based on three principles:

- **Comprehensive**: Everything that happens in Nango for your integrations produces an "operation" in the logs
- **Detailed**: Every operation, and every log message, contains detailed information about the integration, [connection](/guides/use-cases/api-auth#what-is-a-connection%3F), and [function](/guides/platform/functions). Error messages are as detailed as the external APIs allow.
- **Customizable**: You can easily log your own messages from functions you write. To consume logs, you can either use our built-in interface, or export them with our [OpenTelemetry exporter](#opentelemetry-logs-export)

## Overview of Nango logs

Logs are structured into:
- Operations: High-level actions happening in your Nango account (e.g. sync executed, connection created, webhook processed)
- Log messages: Nested in operations, these provide details on what happened (e.g. HTTP request executed, data validation warning, custom log message)

Nango provides detailed filtering & searching of logs messages by integration, connection, operation type, status, etc.

We recommend exploring the logs in your own Nango account under _Logs_.

## OpenTelemetry logs export

Nango supports exporting logs with OpenTelemetry.

We recommend this for:
- Advanced custom metrics
- Advanced alerting & escalation paths (e.g. segment sync errors by customer account for customized escalation paths)

To set up OpenTelemetry export, follow our [OpenTelemetry logs export setup guide](/implementation-guides/platform/open-telemetry-logs-export).
