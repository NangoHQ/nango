Lifecycle events let you customize Nango's behaviour at different points in a [Connection](/guides/use-cases/api-auth#what-is-a-connection%3F)'s lifecyle.

## How lifecycle events work

Lifecycle events are triggered by the Nango platform when certain things happen for a [Connection](/guides/use-cases/api-auth#what-is-a-connection%3F).

You can customize Nango's behaviour by registering an event handler [Function](/guides/platform/functions) for an event and specific integration.

For example: You register a `post-connection-creation` event handler function on your Salesforce integration. Nango will call this function once for each Salesforce connection, immediately after it has been created.

All lifecycle event executions are logged in Nango's [logs](/guides/platform/logs).

To implement a lifecycle event handler, follow our [implementation guide]().

## Supported lifcycle events

Nango currently supports the following events:
- `post-connection-creation` occurs when a connection has been created.
- `pre-connection-deletion` occurs before a connection is deleted.

Checkout the [lifecycle events reference](/reference/integration-configuration#on-events-fields) for details.

## Common use cases for lifecycle events

- Integration-specific validation logic for API keys or other credentials (e.g. check permissions to access a specific endpoint)
- Register webhook subscriptions after a connection has been created
- Fetch account configuration information from the external API
- De-register webhook subscriptions when a connection is deleted
- Revoking an access token on the external API when a connection is deleted
