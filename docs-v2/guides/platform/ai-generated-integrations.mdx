Building product integrations with Nango is much faster when using AI tools.

## Demo video: generate integrations with Cursor

<div style={{ position: 'relative', overflow: 'hidden', paddingTop: '56.25%' }}>
    <iframe
        style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }}
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qOxdNcFLukc?modestbranding=1&rel=0&autohide=1"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameBorder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowFullScreen
    ></iframe>
</div>

## How to leverage AI agents for integrations

AI agents accelerate integration work. They quickly read API docs, explore endpoints, and draft transformation logic. They are particularly effective at generating request/response handling, schema mapping, and other boilerplate so you can focus on product behavior.

Nango provides the production framework and infrastructure that makes these agents effective.

Define your integrations as [Actions](/guides/use-cases/actions) and [Syncs](/guides/use-cases/syncs) with strongly typed inputs and outputs, while our SDK handles pagination, retries, and rate limits.

The Nango infrastructure handles code execution, secure credentials management, detailed logs and observability, and seamless scaling to any customer size.
