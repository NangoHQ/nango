Nango tracks and logs key authorization events:

- User opened or closed the Connect UI
- User opened or closed the OAuth modal
- User viewed a new screen (integration list, input form, success/failure)

You can explore these events in the _Logs_ tab of the Nango UI, by filtering logs by `Type: Connection created`.

We also added a chart summarizing all authorization attempts by outcome:

- Success
- Cancelled
- Technical failure

This chart is available on the _Home_ tab.
