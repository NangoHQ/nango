# 1. Generate a session token (backend)

In **your backend**, set up an API endpoint that your frontend will call before each authorization attempt to retrieve a session token from Nango.

Here's an example of how your backend can retrieve a session token from Nango ([API](/reference/api/connect/sessions/create) / [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#create-a-connect-session) references):

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Node">

```ts
import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: process.env['<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>'] });

api.post('/sessionToken', (req, res) => {
  // Ask Nango for a secure token
  const res = await nango.createConnectSession({
    end_user: {
      id: '<END-USER-ID>',
      email: '<OPTIONAL-END-USER-EMAIL>',
      display_name: '<OPTIONAL-END-USER-DISPLAY-NAME>',
    },
    organization: {
      id: '<OPTIONAL-ORG-ID>',
      display_name: '<OPTIONAL-ORG-DISPLAY-NAME>'
    },
    allowed_integrations: ['<INTEGRATION-ID>'],
  });

  // Send this token back to your frontend
  res.status(200).send({
    sessionToken: res.data.token
  });
});
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="cURL">

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.nango.dev/connect/sessions \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "end_user": {
      "id": "<REQUIRED-END-USER-ID>",
      "email": "<OPTIONAL-END-USER-EMAIL>",
      "display_name": "<OPTIONAL-END-USER-DISPLAY-NAME>"
    },
    "organization": {
      "id": "<OPTIONAL-ORG-ID>",
      "display_name": "<OPTIONAL-ORG-DISPLAY-NAME>"
    },
    "allowed_integrations": [
      "<INTEGRATION-ID>"
    ]
  }'

```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Accordion title="ℹ️ Details on end user and organization information">
  The `end_user` and `organization` information fields help identify which connection belongs to which end user and organization. This information is also used for display purposes in the Nango UI and, in some cases, for custom billing plans.

  <Info>
    The `end_user.id` is required. Pass in your internal ID of the user who initiated the authorization flow. This ID, and potentially the `organization.id`, are necessary for reconciling the connection details that your backend receives from Nango after the connection is created (as described in the [section 3](#3-listen-for-webhooks-and-save-the-connection-id-backend)).
  </Info>

  <Info>
    It's possible that the end use's email in your app will not match the email they use to connect their external account, which is fine.
  </Info>

  <Info>
  **Organization-level connections**

  In some cases, a connection belongs to an organization rather than a user. In such cases, fill in the relevant organization information and use a place holder for the required `end_user.id` (or use the information of the user who initiated the authorization flow). 
  </Info>  

</Accordion>

<Tip>
  Passing a list of integration IDs in `allowed_integrations` will display a list of integrations that the end user can pick from: 

  <Frame caption="Nango's default authorization UI.">
    <img src="/images/connect-integration-list.png" />
  </Frame>

  Passing a single integration ID in `allowed_integrations` will send the end user directly to this integration's authorization flow:

  </Frame>
</Tip>

## 2. Trigger the auth flow (frontend)

In **your frontend**, load the Nango frontend SDK, retrieve the session token from the backend, and trigger the authorization flow.

### Option 1: Use the default UI (Nango Connect)

<Tip>
  Nango's default authorization UI comes with pre-built features:
  - Displays the necessary input fields, validates their format & provides end-user instructions
  - Authorizes a specific integration or can display a list of integrations to choose from
  - Is fully whitelabel, without any Nango branding
</Tip>

<Frame caption="Nango's default authorization UI.">
  <img src="/images/connect-ui.gif" />
</Frame>

```js
import Nango from '@nangohq/frontend';

const nango = new Nango();
const connect = nango.openConnectUI({
  onEvent: (event) => {
    if (event.type === 'close') {
      // Handle modal closed.
    } else if (event.type === 'connect') {
      // Handle auth flow successful.
    }
  },
});

const res = await fetch('/sessionToken', { method: 'POST' }); // Retrieve the session token from your backend.
connect.setSessionToken(res.sessionToken); // A loading indicator is shown until this is set.
```

([SDK reference](/reference/sdks/frontend#connect-using-nango-connect-ui))

### Option 2: Use your custom UI

Refer to the [Authorize in your app (custom UI)](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-custom-ui) guide.

## 3. Listen for webhooks & save the Connection ID (backend)

<Accordion title="👩🏻‍💻 Simplified flow for development">
  In development, you can retrieve the connection ID without relying on webhooks.

	When using the `nango.openConnectUI()` method in the frontend SDK, the connection ID is available in the `event` parameter of the callback:

  ```ts
  await nango.openConnectUI({
      onEvent: (event) {
          if (event.type === 'connect') {
              saveToDatabase(event.payload.connectionId, event.payload.providerConfigKey);
          }
      }
  });
  ```

	However, we do not recommend using this approach in production, as it is safer to avoid exposing the connection ID to the frontend.
</Accordion>

The connection ID, a UUID generated by Nango, is required to manage the connection and access its credentials & data. So you need to persist this ID.

Upon successful authorization, Nango will send a webhook to your backend with the connection ID.

To set up this webhook:
1. go to the _Environment Settings_ tab in the Nango UI
2. specify a _Webhook URL_ where Nango should send notifications
3. enable the _Send New Connection Creation Webhooks_ option
4. create the specified route in your backend to handle Nango webhooks

Successful authorization webhooks sent by Nango are `POST` requests with the following JSON body:
```json
{
    "type": "auth",
    "operation": "creation",
    "success": true,
    "connectionId": "<CONNECTION-ID>",
    "endUser": { "endUserId": "<END-USER-ID>", "organizationId": "<ORGANIZATION-ID>" },
    ...
}
```

For each successful authorization, persist the `connectionId` value alongside its corresponding user or organization, designated by `endUser.endUserId` and `endUser.organizationId`.

# 4. Run the authorization flow

You can now test the authorization flow directly from your app and verify that a connection is created in the Nango UI _Connections_ tab.

## Troubleshoot authorization errors

If an authorization request fails, you can analyze the relevant log in the _Logs_ tab of the Nango UI.

## Re-authorize an existing connection

Details in this [guide](/guides/api-authorization/re-authorize-a-connection).

## Next

You have successfully set up the authorization flow for your users. Next steps:
- View new connections & associated credentials in the _Connections_ tab of the Nango UI
- Retrieve connection credentials with the [API](/reference/api/connection/get) or [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials)
- [Sync](/guides/syncs/use-a-sync) data from APIs
- Perform [actions](/guides/actions/use-an-action) with APIs
- Perform [direct request](/guides/proxy-requests) to APIs
