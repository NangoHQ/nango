There are cases where you need to re-authorize a connection, e.g. credentials have expired or the scopes/permissions have changed.

The simplest way is to delete and recreate the connection, but this will reset the connection's attached data ([metadata](/guides/customer-configuration#store-customer-specific-data), [synced records](/guides/syncs/overview#sync-endpoints-and-data-caching)). Most of the time when testing, this is fine. 

Follow the instructions below if you need to re-authorize a connection without altering it's attached data.

# Re-authorize a connection from your app

<Tip>
This is the recommended way to re-authorize **production** connections, so customers can re-authorize independently, without having to manually send you their account credentials.
</Tip>

You can implement the re-authorization flow in your app by having your backend call a different endpoint when the connection already exists.

Instead of generating the [default endpoint](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui#1-generate-a-session-token-backend) to generate a session token, use the `POST /connect/sessions/reconnect` endpoint ([API](/reference/api/connect/sessions/reconnect)/[SDK](/reference/sdks/node#create-a-reconnect-session) reference) to generate a session token meant for reconnection. This token is then used on the frontend in the same way as when creating a connection, but it will reconnect the existing connection instead.

```ts
import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: process.env['<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>'] });

api.post('/sessionToken', (req, res) => {
  // Ask Nango for a secure token to reconnect
  const res = await nango.createReconnectSession({
    connection_id: "<CONNECTION-ID>",
    integration_id: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
  });

  // Send this token back to your frontend
  res.status(200).send({
    sessionToken: res.data.token
  });
});

# Re-authorize a connection from the Nango UI

<Tip>
    This is only recommended for **test** connections, not production connections. 

    If you do intend to re-authorize a production connection from the Nango UI, be sure to use your customer's account credentials.
</Tip>

<Note>
    The flow to re-authorize connections from the Nango UI is legacy. It will revamp shortly. 
</Note>

To re-connect from the UI, go to the _Connections_ tab > click _Add Test Connection_ > click _Or use deprecated flow_. Pick the relevant integration and enter the connection ID of the connection you want to re-authorize. 

This flow leverage's the headless client. Check out the [reference](/reference/sdks/frontend#connect-using-the-headless-client) to pass the right parameters based on the integration's authorization type (OAuth, API key, basic auth).
