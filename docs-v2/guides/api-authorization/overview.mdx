<Tip>
This feature is provided by Nango for free, on cloud or self-hosted editions.

Integrating with APIs starts with gaining access to them—a process known as **authorization**. Nango simplifies this step, enabling secure connections between your app and third-party APIs on behalf of your end users.
## What is API authorization?

API authorization is the process of granting your app access to a third-party API. This access is provided by your end users, allowing your app to interact with the API on their behalf for seamless integrations.

<Info>
    Authorization is different from authentication (signing in to your app through Google, etc.). Nango focuses on authorization and does not handle authentication for your app.

### How authorization works

1. **User credential input**:  
   Users provide their account credentials through a secure popup interface in your app. This flow ensures credentials are handled safely while offering a seamless user experience.

2. **Access granted**:  
   Once authorized, your app interacts with the API using permissions granted by the user.

### Multiple authorization modes

APIs often employ different authorization methods, such as **OAuth**, **API keys**, or proprietary protocols. Nango supports these methods and can handle APIs with multiple authorization types.

### Connections: user-level or organization-level

When a user grants access, a **connection** is created in Nango. Connections can be:
- **User-level**: Specific to individual users.
- **Organization-level**: Shared access for an entire group or entity.

You can also manage multiple connections for the same API and user, offering flexibility for complex use cases.

## Secure credential management

Nango is designed with security as a top priority:
- **Secure storage**: Credentials are encrypted and securely stored.
- **Token refreshing**: OAuth tokens are automatically refreshed before expiration.
- **Credential access and export**: Credentials can be retrieved or exported at any time to avoid vendor lock-in.
- **Expired credential detection**: Nango detects and flags expired credentials, ensuring uninterrupted API access.

## Customizable authorization flows

Nango adapts to your app’s branding and user experience while ensuring transparency and seamless integration.

- **Default UI components**:  
  - Inputs are validated.  
  - End-user instructions are provided, such as guidance for obtaining API keys or other required parameters.  
  - Nango operates transparently, meaning users are unaware of its involvement, ensuring a native feel.

- **Fully customizable flows**:  
  - You can fully customize the popup UI for inputting credentials to match your app's design.  
  - Nango remains transparent, providing the same native experience while managing authorization complexities under the hood.

### Automatic parameter handling

Nango simplifies authorization by:
- Identifying required parameters for each API.
- Validating input formats.
- Verifying credentials validity.
