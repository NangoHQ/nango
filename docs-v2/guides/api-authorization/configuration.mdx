# 1. Create an account

Sign up for a Nango account (free, no credit card):
[![Try Nango Cloud](/images/nango-deploy-button.svg)](https://app.nango.dev/signup)

# 2. Create an integration

Go to the [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) tab, click  _Configure New Integration_ and select the API to integrate with.

<Tip>
    Each API has a dedicated Nango documentation page with useful links, gotchas, etc.
</Tip>

APIs have different ways to authorize requests: OAuth, API key, Basic, custom. Nango abstracts away the difficulties of working with each one.

<Accordion title="⚠️ Required for OAuth APIs">
    OAuth APIs require you to register your OAuth application on their developer portal.

    When registering, the API provider will prompt you for the `Callback URL`. Use the URL displayed in the Nango integration settings. Remember to register the required scopes in the Nango integration settings and, if necessary, with the API provider.

    Collect your OAuth app's `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from the API portal and input them in your Nango integration settings.
</Accordion>

# 3. Test the authorization

If you don't have one already, create a test account for the external API you want to integrate with.

On the Nango [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) tab, click _Add Test Connection_ to test the authorization flow. Pick an integration, click _Authorize_ and enter your test account credentials to authorize the API.

Once authorized, go to the [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) tab to see the newly created connection. The "Authorization" tab contains the credentials necessary to consume the external API. These credentials are securely stored and automatically refreshed by Nango.
