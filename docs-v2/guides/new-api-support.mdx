# Pre-requisites

- You have access to a test account for the API
- The API is publicly accessible
- The API is of type HTTP or SOAP

Nango support all authorization types (OAuth, API key, basic), including custom ones.

# Option 1: Ask Nango to add support for a new API

The simplest way to add a new API is to ask us in the [community](https://nango.dev/slack) on the `#contribution` channel. 

We usually deliver them in &lt;48h, for free. 

# Option 2: Contribute a new API yourself

To contribute a new API, follow the steps below and check out past [PRs](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) starting with `feat(integrations)` for examples.

### Add an API configuration

Fork the [repo](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango) and edit the API configurations file ([providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml)).

You can test the configuration of your new provider with this command:

```sh
npx tsx scripts/validation/providers/validate.ts
```

### Test the API

To test your new provider, go to the `nango` repo root and run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

<Tip>
You can modify the ports in the `docker-compose.yaml` file if there are conflicts with
other local services on your host machine.
</Tip>

When you are ready to test your API:

**Create an integration**

Open the [local Nango UI](http://localhost:3003) in your browser and add a new integration with your freshly added API.

**Create a connection**

Create a new connection for this API in the Nango UI, completing the authorization flow.

**Verify the connection**

If all goes well, you should see your new connection in the _Connections_ tab. Check the connection details and make sure that the credentials are valid.

### Document the API

Add a `<api>.mdx` file (e.g. `github.mdx`) for you API to the `docs-v2/integrations/all` folder. Check out [other examples](/integrations) to fill out the content of the documentation page.

Reference the page in the `docs-v2/mint.json` file in the `Supported APIs` group in alphabetical order.


### Submit a pull request

Verify your contribution against [examples of past contributions](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+label%3Aapi+).

Submit a pull request with the new provider to the Nango repo. Please thoroughly test the integration!

Thanks a lot for your contribution!! ❤️
