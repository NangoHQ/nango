Our built-in MCP server can expose your integrations directly to an LLM.

## When should you use the MCP server?

- You want to expose custom tools to an LLM
- You don't want to create your own tool calling wrapper/infrastructure

Common examples:
- Exposing your "create-opportunity" [Action](/guides/use-cases/actions) to an LLM
- Creating additional, custom tools not supported by an APIs native remote MCP Server

## Key facts

- The built-in MCP server exposes the [Actions](/guides/use-cases/actions) of your integration
- Nango generates one MCP server for each [Connection](/guides/use-cases/api-auth#what-is-a-connection%3F)
    - This makes MCP server specific to an integrations AND to one connected account of the integration
    - This ensures the account's permissions are respected on the external API
- MCP tool calls are Action invocations under the hood, and get logged as such in Nango's [logs]()

## MCP Server in detail

### Tool calling without the MCP server

Many AI apps use custom tool calling wrappers, rather than MCP servers.

You can still use Actions as tools for LLMs without our MCP server.

- Nango provides an introspection endpoint to list available actions ([reference](/reference/api/scripts/config))
- You can invoke actions directly from your backend to execute the tool (see [Actions](/guides/use-cases/actions))
