API Auth lets you connect your app with [500+ APIs](/integrations/all).

## When should you use API auth?

- You want to let your users connect their external accounts to your app
- You want to avoid implementing OAuth flows, guides on where to find API keys, refresh token logic, etc. yourself
- You want a white-label experience for your users to connect

All Nango customers use API auth. Everything else, [Syncs](/guides/use-cases/syncs), [Actions](/guides/use-cases/actions), and [Webhooks](/guides/use-cases/webhooks), builds on it.


## Key facts

- Supports dozens of auth methods: OAuth 2.0, 2.1, API key, basic auth, custom auth models
- Securely stores all credentials with encryption at rest & in transit (learn more on our [Trust center](https://trust.nango.dev))
- Automatically refreshes access tokens as required. Ensures access tokens don't expire.
- Detects broken access tokens and notifies your backend with a webhook
- Fully white-label: Users authorize your app. No Nango branding.
- Full control: You always have access to your user's API keys & access tokens
- Provides detailed end-user guides to find API keys and other parameters (subdomain, project id, etc.) required to connect
- Automatically validates API keys & other credentials on connection
- Anybody can [contribute new APIs](/implementation-guides/platform/contribute-new-api) to Nango, or our team can add new APIs for you
- All authorization attempts create detailed logs in Nango's [logs](/guides/platform/logs)

## How API auth works

1. Configure the integration in your Nango dashboard
2. Embed the auth flow in your application with our [implementation guide](/implementation-guides/api-auth/implement-api-auth)
3. Fetch credentials from Nango, or use them with [Syncs](/guides/use-cases/syncs), [Actions](/guides/use-cases/actions), [Webhooks](/guides/use-cases/webhooks), and our [Proxy](/guides/use-cases/proxy)

## API Auth in detail

### What is a Connection?

Each time a customer connects an external account this creates a Connection in Nango.

You can think of a Connection in Nango as a set of credentials for an integration (e.g. a Github API access token).

It is up to you how you associate the Connection with objects in your application. You can link them to an account in your application, a user, or any other object, such as a project or workspace. Which of these is best depends on the use case of your integration, and whether you want each user, each account, etc. to set the integration up.

Integrations in Nango always run in the context of a Connection.

For example, if you define a [Sync](/guides/use-cases/syncs) for your Github integration, this sync will run in the context of each Github connection in your account.

### Adding support for new APIs

Nango is designed to make it fast & easy to add support for new APIs.

If you need support for an API we don't have yet, you can either:
- [Contribute support for it yourself](/implementation-guides/platform/contribute-new-api) (we take ~24h to review, merge & deploy high-quality PRs)
- Request support on the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack) or your private Slack connect channel with Nango
  - We prioritize requests by plan. Free users can expect support for new APIs in 5-10 business days, Enterprise customers \<48h
