Webhooks let you listen to incoming webhooks from external APIs, and react to them.

## When should you use webhooks?

- You want to know about changes in the external API in realtime
- You want to build a realtime data sync from the external API to your product
- You don't want to deal with how each API implements webhooks, subscriptions, attributing webhooks to users, etc.
- You don't want to build and maintain infrastructure to deal with webhook floods, debouncing, etc.

Common examples:
- Listen to "contact updated" webhook from HubSpot, Attio, etc.
- Triggering an "order" sync run whenever Shopify sends a "new order" webhook

## Key facts

- Incoming webhooks are processed by Nango's infrastructure
    - It auto-scales, and provides tools to deal with webhook floods, debouncing, etc.
    - You have full control over webhooks processing
- Each webhook gets attributed to its corresponding [Connection](/guides/use-cases/api-auth#what-is-a-connection%3F) (a user or organization that has setup a specific integration)
- Webhooks can be forwarded to your app, or trigger a [Function]() in Nango for processing
- Webhooks can be combined with [syncs](/guides/use-cases/syncs) to create real-time syncs to your product
- All incoming webhooks create detailed logs in Nango's [logs]()


## How webhooks work

1. Configure webhooks for your integration (if necessary, Nango provides docs)
2. Nango enables the webhooks you want for each account that connects (if required by the API)
3. Nango processes incoming webhooks and attributes them to the correct account
4. You decide for each webhook type how it gets processed:
    - Forward to your backend
    - Trigger a [Function]() in Nango to process the webhook
5. Nango stores detailed logs about each incoming webhook and it's associated processing

Follow our [implement an webhook]() guide to use webhooks in your product.

## Webhooks in detail

### Forwarding vs. processing in Nango

**Forwarding**: Nango forwards the webhook from the external API to your webhooks endpoint.

**Processing in Nango**: The webhook from the external API triggers a [Function](/guides/platform/functions) in Nango. This lets you make additional API requests to the external API and store data in Nango's [Sync](/guides/use-cases/syncs) cache.

You can also combine the two: Process the webhook in Nango, fetch additional data from the external API, and then forward the final object as a webhook to your app.

### Real-time syncs with webhooks + polling

You can combine webhooks and polling syncs into a single, realtime sync.

With this setup, both webhooks and the polling syncs update the same [Sync](/guides/use-cases/syncs) cache in Nango. Nango applies change detection to the objects in the cache, and notifies your application when new data is available.

This gives you the best of both worlds: The reliability of polling syncs, and the real-time updates of webhooks.

To set this up, follow our [implementation guide for real-time syncs]().
