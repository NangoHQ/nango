The proxy provides an easy way to make authenticated API requests to external APIs.

## When should you the proxy?

- You want to make authenticated API requests directly from your backend
- You would like automatic retries and reate-limit handling for your API requests
- You want your API requests to be logged in Nango

Common examples:
- Fetching files, and other large binary content, from an external API
- Running API requests directly from your backend to an external API
- Allowing AI agents to make arbitrary, authenticated API requests to an external API

## Key facts

- The proxy proxies API requests from your backend to the external API, and back
- Nango automatically adds any required authentication or API specific config (e.g. subdomain) to the API request
- Nango can, optionally, retry failed requsts and handle rate-limits
- Proxied API requests are executed 1:1 against the external API, and its response is transferred back to you without modification
- All proxy requests are logged in Nango's [logs]()
