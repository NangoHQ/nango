Nango offers an Enterprise Self-Hosted deployment option for customers who need full control over their infrastructure. This guide covers deployment, scaling, updates, and other key operational details.

## Features

All paid features available on Nango Cloud are also included in the Enterprise self-hosted edition.

## Plan requirement

A [Scale plan](https://www.nango.dev/pricing) subscription is required.

## Intended users

Optimized for large, regulated enterprises.

## Deployment

By default, Nango is deployed using [Helm charts](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango-helm-charts). Custom deployments (e.g., ECS) are possible with our guidance.

We don't provide a CloudFormation template or AWS CDK script at this time, but we could if you need it.

## Updates

Updates are distributed via versioned Helm charts. A staging environment is recommended to test updates before production.

Update cadence is flexible based on your needs.

## Cloud provider support

Supports all major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).

## Components & recommended configuration

- **4 Node services** (Server, Persist, Runner, Jobs, Orchestrator): 1 CPU, 2GB RAM per service
- **Postgres database**: 2 CPU, 8GB RAM, 128GB storage
- **Redis data store**: 128MB
- **ElasticSearch data store**: 2 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 30GB storage
- **Object storage (e.g. S3)**: less than 500MB of storage

## Scaling

The default configuration supports 1M+ sync/action executions per day (assuming ~2s execution time per action/sync).

Auto-scaling is not provided out-of-the-box yet, but the default configuration scales far. We can guide you on configuring auto-scaling when needed.

Bottlenecks mostly depend on:
- **Action/sync execution time**: solved by scaling the Runner service vertically, then horizontally.
- **Cached records & size (for syncs only)**: solved by scaling Postgres vertically.

## Data storage

- **Postgres:** Control plane, data plane, orchestrator
- **Redis:** Socket info, token refresh locks, log index caching, rate limits
- **ElasticSearch:** Logs
- **Object storage (e.g., S3):** Compiled integration code

## Using existing data stores

Yes, Nango is flexible with data store setups. However, we recommend a separate instance for independent scaling.

## Internet access requirements

- **Server:** Required for proxy requests, credential management, and incoming/outgoing webhooks (inbound & outbound traffic).
- **Runner:** Required for reading/writing data from external APIs during sync and action executions (outbound traffic only).

## Multi-AZ support

Multi-AZ deployments are not automated but can be manually configured. Helm chart support is planned.

## Exporting billing metrics

For usage-based billing, certain anonymous metrics must be exported to Nango. This can be done automatically or manually, depending on your preference. Weâ€™ll coordinate with your team during setup.

## Exporting metrics & logs

Yes, metrics and logs can be exported to any monitoring tool using our OpenTelemetry Export add-on. Additional metrics and logs can be added upon request.
