Nango offers an Enterprise Self-Hosted deployment option for customers who need full control over their infrastructure. This guide covers deployment, scaling, updates, and other key operational details.

## What features are available?

All paid features available on Nango Cloud are also available on the Enterprise self-hosted edition. 

## What plan is needed?

The Enterprise self-hosted edition requires a [Scale plan](https://www.nango.dev/pricing) subscription.

## Who is this option for?

Enterprise self-hosting is optimized for large, regulated enterprises.

## How is it deployed? 

By default, using Helm charts. There is no CloudFormation template or AWS CDK script provided at this time.

We can also guide you to do custom deployments, e.g. for ECS. 

## How and how often is it updated?

Updates are distributed through versioned Helm charts.

A staging environment is recommended to mitigate risks before applying updates to production.

The update cadence is custom based on your need to benefit from new functionalities.

## What cloud provider does Nango support? 

All major cloud providers are supported (AWS, GCP, Azure).

## What is the recommended configuration? 

- All services (Server, Persist, Runner, Jobs, Orchestrator): 1 CPU, 2GB RAM per service
- Postgres: 2 CPU, 8GB RAM, 128GB storage
- Redis: 128MB
- ElasticSearch: 2 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 30GB storage

## How does scaling work? Is there auto-scaling?

The default configuration scales far: 1M+ sync/action executions per day, assuming an average execution time of 2 seconds.

Nango does not yet provide auto-scaling out-of-the-box. 

The main bottlenecks depend on:
- Number of cached records & record size: Postgres database can be scaled vertically
- Action/sync execution time: Runner service can be scaled vertically, then horizontally

## What data is stored in object storage vs. Postgres vs. Redis vs. Elastic? 

- Object storage (e.g. S3): compiled code
- Postgres: control plane, data plane, orchestrator
- Redis: socket information, locks for token refreshes, caching of log indexes, rate-limits
- Elastic: logs

## Can you use existing data stores (Postgres, Redis, ElasticSearch)?

Yes, Nango is not opinionated about your data store setup. However, we recommend using a separate instance to allow independent scaling.

## Which services need internet access?

- Server: Required for proxy requests, credentials management, and outgoing/incoming webhooks (in/out traffic)
- Runner: Required for reading/writing data from/to external APIs (out traffic)

## Does the deployment support multi-AZ deployments?

Multi-AZ deployments are not automated but can be configured manually. We plan to add support for this in our Helm charts in the future.

## How to export metrics for billing?

To enable usage-based billing, Nango requires certain anonymous metrics from your self-hosted instance. These metrics can be automatically exported to Nango or, if preferred, manually provided by your team to ensure no communication with Nango’s servers from your infrastructure. We’ll coordinate with your team during the setup process to determine the best approach.

## Can metrics/logs/spans be exported?

Yes, they can be exported to any monitoring tool using our OpenTelemetry Export add-on. Additional metrics/logs can be added upon request.
