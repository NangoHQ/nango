## When to use the Nango Proxy

The **Nango Proxy** makes it faster for you to query external APIs by handling:
* Authentication
* Automatically sets the correct base URL
* Automatic logging & monitoring
* Rate-limit handling (with automatic & configurable retries)

It is especially useful for:
* One-off requests to fetch e.g. metadata from the API
* Writing data back to the API on demand
* Performing API requests in Sync scripts

If you want to continuously sync data from the external API, check out the [Continuous Syncing Guide](/guides/sync).

## Using the Proxy

<Tip>
To use the Nango Proxy, you should have set up an Integration and created a Connection already (cf. [API Authorization Guide](/guides/oauth)).

### Proxy requests 

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Backend Node SDK">

The backend Node SDK supports the Proxy and offers convenience functions such as `nango.get({})`, `nango.post({})` etc.

Refer to the [SDK Reference](/sdks) for full details on proxy options.

```typescript
const res = await nango.proxy({
    method: 'POST',
    endpoint: '/calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList',
    providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
    connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>',
    retries: 5, // Retries with exponential backoff (optional, default 0)
    data: {
        id: 1,
        colorId: 'blue',
        selected: true
    }
});
```

<Tip>
    Some APIs are not yet fully-configured to work with the Proxy and require you to indicate the base URL. 

    You can check if your API contains the `base_api_url` field in the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) configuration file.

    If not, you need to add a `baseUrlOverride` field in your call to the Proxy as follow:
    ```typescript
const res = await nango.proxy({
    ...
    baseUrlOverride: 'https://gmail.googleapis.com',
    ...
});
    ```

    Feel free to contribuge the `base_api_url` field to any API in the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) public file, or reach out on the [Slack community](https://www.nango.dev/slack) to ask us to do it.
</Tip>
</Tab>

<Tab title="REST API">

You can use the Proxy with Nango's REST API (cf. [proxy API reference](/api-reference/proxy/get)):

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' \
-H 'Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>' \
-H 'Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>' \
-d '{"colorId: "blue"}' \
'https://api.nango.dev/proxy/<API-ENDPOINT>'
```


<Tip>
    Some APIs are not yet fully-configured to work with the Proxy and require you to indicate the base URL to use. 

    You can check if your API contains the `base_api_url` field in the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) configuration file.

    If not, you need to add a `Base-Url-Override` header in your call to the Proxy as follow:
    ```bash
    -H 'Base-Url-Override: https://gmail.googleapis.com' \
    ```

    Feel free to add the `base_api_url` field to any API and contribute the change, or reach out on the [Slack community](https://www.nango.dev/slack) to ask us to do it.

### Proxy request logging

All requests that run through the Proxy are automatically logged to the Activity tab in the Nango Dashboard. The logs there can help you debug failing requests.
