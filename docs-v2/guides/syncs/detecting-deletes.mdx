Sometimes you need to know when an object you are syncing has been deleted in the external system.

Detecting deletes is not a universal switch.
It differs significantly between full refresh and incremental syncs. Pick the strategy that matches your sync type.

## Detecting deletes in incremental syncs

Incremental syncs only fetch the delta (new/updated records) since the previous run, so Nango has no built-in way to know which records disappeared on the provider side.

You must actively tell Nango which IDs have been removed by calling `nango.batchDelete()` ([full reference](/reference/scripts#delete-records)) inside the sync script.

### When can you use this?

You can use `nango.batchDelete()` if the external API supports one of the following:

- A dedicated “recently deleted” endpoint (e.g. `GET /entities/deleted?since=...`)
- The ability to filter or sort by a deletion timestamp
- The ability to filter or sort by last-modified timestamp _and_ records include a flag like `is_deleted`, `archived`, etc.

If none of these are available, you cannot detect deletes with an incremental sync.

You'll either need to switch to a full refresh sync or skip deletion detection.

Switching to a full refresh sync should not be done lightly. Make sure you [understand the tradeoffs](/guides/syncs/overview#sync-modes%3A-full-refresh-vs-incremental).

### Example incremental sync with deletion detection

```ts
import { createSync } from 'nango';
import * as z from 'zod';

const AccountSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  name: z.string()
});

export default createSync({
  description: 'Incrementally sync Accounts & handle deletions',
  frequency: 'every 2 hours',
  syncType: 'incremental',
  endpoints: [{ method: 'GET', path: '/accounts', group: 'Accounts' }],
  models: { Account: AccountSchema },

  exec: async (nango) => {
    // (1) Fetch newly created / updated accounts
    // Save them with await nango.batchSave(...);

    // (2) Fetch deletions since the last run (if this is not the first run)
    const last = nango.lastSyncDate;
    if (last) {
        const res = await nango.get({
            endpoint: '/accounts/deleted',
            params: { since: last.toISOString() }
        });

        // (3) Tell Nango which IDs have been deleted in the external system
        const toDelete = res.data.map((row: any) => ({ id: row.id }));
        if (toDelete.length) {
            await nango.batchDelete(toDelete, 'Account');
        }
    }
  }
});
```

## Detecting deletes in full refresh syncs

Full refresh syncs download all records on every run.

Nango can therefore detect removals by computing the diff between two consecutive result sets. Enable this behaviour with the `trackDeletes` flag ([full reference](/reference/integration-configuration#param-track-deletes)).

<Warning>
**Do not use `trackDeletes` with incremental syncs**.

The trackDeletes flag is only safe for full refresh syncs. 
Enabling it on an incremental sync will cause Nango to treat any record that wasn't fetched in the current delta window as “missing” and mark it deleted, corrupting your data.
</Warning>

### Example full refresh sync with deletion detection

```ts
import { createSync } from 'nango';
import * as z from 'zod';

const TicketSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  subject: z.string(),
  status: z.string()
});

export default createSync({
  description: 'Fetch all help-desk tickets',
  frequency: 'every day',
  syncType: 'full',
  trackDeletes: true,       // Enables deletion detection for the sync
  endpoints: [{ method: 'GET', path: '/tickets', group: 'Tickets' }],
  models: { Ticket: TicketSchema },

  exec: async (nango) => {
    // Unlike incremental syncs, the execution logic
    // doesn't need any changes for deletion detection in full refresh syncs
    const tickets = await nango.paginate<{ id: string; subject: string; status: string }>({
      endpoint: '/tickets',
      paginate: { type: 'cursor', cursorPathInResponse: 'next', cursorNameInRequest: 'cursor', responsePath: 'tickets' }
    });

    for await (const page of tickets) {
      await nango.batchSave(page, 'Ticket');
    }
  }
});
```

### How the algorithm works

1. After a successful run, Nango stores the list of record IDs.
2. On the next run, Nango compares the new list with the old one.
3. Any records missing in the new list are marked as deleted (soft delete). They remain accessible from the Nango cache, but with `record._metadata.deleted === true`.

<Warning>
**Careful with exception handling**

Nango only performs the diff when the sync run finishes successfully (=without uncaught exceptions).

If your script fails part-way, throw (or re-throw) the error so the run is detected as failed by Nango.

Otherwise Nango might treat a truncated dataset as complete and marks valid records as deleted.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting deletion detection issues

| Symptom | Likely cause |
| ------ | ---- |
| Records that still exist in the source API are shown as `deleted` in Nango | `trackDeletes` was enabled on an incremental sync, or a full refresh run silently failed |
| You never see deleted records                                              | Check if deletion detection is implemented for the sync. |
