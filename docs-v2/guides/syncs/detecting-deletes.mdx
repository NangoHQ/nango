Sometimes you need to know when an object you are syncing has been deleted in the external system.

Detecting deletes is not a universal switch.
It differs significantly between full refresh and incremental syncs. Pick the strategy that matches your sync type.

## Detecting deletes in incremental syncs

Incremental syncs only fetch the delta (new/updated records) since the previous run, so Nango has no built-in way to know which records disappeared on the provider side.

You must actively tell Nango which IDs have been removed by calling `nango.batchDelete()` ([full reference](/reference/scripts#delete-records)) inside the sync script.

### When can you use this?

You can use `nango.batchDelete()` if the external API supports one of the following:

- A dedicated “recently deleted” endpoint (e.g. `GET /entities/deleted?since=...`)
- The ability to filter or sort by a deletion timestamp
- The ability to filter or sort by last-modified timestamp _and_ records include a flag like `is_deleted`, `archived`, etc.

If none of these are available, you cannot detect deletes with an incremental sync.

You'll either need to switch to a full refresh sync or skip deletion detection.

Switching to a full refresh sync should not be done lightly. Make sure you [understand the tradeoffs](/guides/syncs/overview#sync-modes%3A-full-refresh-vs-incremental).

### Example incremental sync with deletion detection

```ts
import { createSync } from 'nango';
import * as z from 'zod';

const AccountSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  name: z.string()
});

export default createSync({
  description: 'Incrementally sync Accounts & handle deletions',
  frequency: 'every 2 hours',
  syncType: 'incremental',
  endpoints: [{ method: 'GET', path: '/accounts', group: 'Accounts' }],
  models: { Account: AccountSchema },

  exec: async (nango) => {
    // (1) Fetch newly created / updated accounts
    // Save them with await nango.batchSave(...);

    // (2) Fetch deletions since the last run (if this is not the first run)
    const last = nango.lastSyncDate;
    if (last) {
        const res = await nango.get({
            endpoint: '/accounts/deleted',
            params: { since: last.toISOString() }
        });

        // (3) Tell Nango which IDs have been deleted in the external system
        const toDelete = res.data.map((row: any) => ({ id: row.id }));
        if (toDelete.length) {
            await nango.batchDelete(toDelete, 'Account');
        }
    }
  }
});
```

## Detecting deletes in syncs

Nango can detect removals by computing the diff between two consecutive result sets.
Enable this behaviour by calling the `deleteRecordsFromPreviousExecutions` function. ([full reference](/reference/scripts#detect-deletions-automatically)).

### Example full refresh sync with deletion detection

```ts
import { createSync } from 'nango';
import * as z from 'zod';

const TicketSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  subject: z.string(),
  status: z.string()
});

export default createSync({
  description: 'Fetch all help-desk tickets',
  frequency: 'every day',
  syncType: 'full',
  endpoints: [{ method: 'GET', path: '/tickets', group: 'Tickets' }],
  models: { Ticket: TicketSchema },

  exec: async (nango) => {
    // Unlike incremental syncs, the execution logic
    // doesn't need any changes for deletion detection in full refresh syncs
    const tickets = await nango.paginate<{ id: string; subject: string; status: string }>({
      endpoint: '/tickets',
      paginate: { type: 'cursor', cursorPathInResponse: 'next', cursorNameInRequest: 'cursor', responsePath: 'tickets' }
    });

    for await (const page of tickets) {
      await nango.batchSave(page, 'Ticket');
    }

    // Delete records that don't exist anymore
    await nango.deleteRecordsFromPreviousExecutions('Ticket');
  }
});
```

### How the algorithm works

1. During each execution, Nango stores the list of record IDs.
2. When calling `deleteRecordsFromPreviousExecutions`, Nango compares the new list with the old one.
3. Any records missing in the new list are marked as deleted (soft delete). They remain accessible from the Nango cache, but with `record._metadata.deleted === true`.

<Warning>
**Be careful with exception handling when using** `deleteRecordsFromPreviousExecutions`

If you’re using `deleteRecordsFromPreviousExecutions`, exception handling becomes critical:
- If your sync doesn’t fetch the full dataset, but still call `deleteRecordsFromPreviousExecutions` (e.g. you catch and swallow an exception), Nango will attempt the diff on an incomplete dataset.
- This leads to false positives, where valid records are mistakenly considered deleted.

✅ What You Should Do

If a failure prevents full data retrieval, make sure the sync run fails and `deleteRecordsFromPreviousExecutions` is not being called:
- Let exceptions bubble up and interrupt the run.
- If you’re using `try/catch`, re-throw exceptions that indicate incomplete data.
</Warning>
<Warning>
**How to use** `deleteRecordsFromPreviousExecutions` **safely**
If some records are incorrectly marked as deleted due to calling `deleteRecordsFromPreviousExecutions` improperly, you can trigger a full resync (via the UI or API) to restore the correct data state.

However, because `deleteRecordsFromPreviousExecutions` relies on logic in your sync scripts—and mistakes there can lead to false deletions—we strongly recommend not performing irreversible destructive actions (like hard-deleting records in your system) based solely on deletions reported by Nango. A full resync should always be able to recover from issues.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting deletion detection issues

| Symptom                                                                    | Likely cause                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Records that still exist in the source API are shown as `deleted` in Nango | sync didn't save all records (silent failures) before calling `deleteRecordsFromPreviousExecutions` |
| You never see deleted records                                              | Check if deleteRecordsFromPreviousExecutions is correctly called by the sync                        |
