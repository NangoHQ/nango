## Why Nango?

Nango is based on two assumptions:

1.  product integrations require [common infrastructure](/core-concepts#infra) such as auth, ETL, webhooks, observability, etc.
2.  one-size-fits-all models & API aggregation fall apart as developers build multiple & complex integrations

Nango aims provides [common infrastructure](/core-concepts#infra) to accelerate integration development, without limiting the ability to build many complex integrations. To achieve this, we let developers define their own API requests & models, with the assistance of our tooling.

## Why Open Source?

Nango is open-source and leverages the community to:

1. improve Nango's [infrastructure](/core-concepts#infra)
2. contribute new [Integration Templates](/core-concepts#templates)
3. share knowledge about external API quirks

## Glossary

Nango is defined around a couple important abstractions:

### Integration Templates[](#templates)

An Integration Template (e.g. the `hubspot` template) designates the configuration, within Nango, that is specific to an external API. In particular:

-   Auth-related configuration (auth type, OAuth URLs, auth quirks, etc.)
-   Sync-related configuration (rate-limits, pagination strategy, etc.)

These templates are contributed and enhanced by Nango and its community. Templates allow to rapidly adapt Nango to work with any API, by editing a `.yaml` configuration file.

### Integrations[](#integrations)

Developers create Integrations, based on [Integration Templates](/core-concepts#templates), to start sharing data with external APIs from their app.

Integrations are created on the Nango Dashboard and later embedded in your product.

[Nango Auth](/nango-auth) is used to let users authorize your integrations (API access).

[Nango Sync](/nango-auth) is used to let you exchange data with external APIs, on behalf of users (API syncing). Nango Sync requires you to write a minimal amount of code (API requests & transformation) to define your integration logic.

### Connections[](#connections)

When an end user authorizes an [Integration](/core-concepts#integrations) in your app, Nango initiates a new Connection. E.g. `user1` authorizes a `Github` integration to sync issues in your app.

Connections represent the relation between an end user and an external API. In particular, it contains the necessary credentials to access the external API on behalf of the user.

### Nango Infrastructure[](#infra)

Nango's infrastructure designate the following components that we see companies rebuilding over and over:

-   Auth server
-   Orchestrator to schedule sync jobs (Temporal)
-   Background workers & ETL pipelines to sync data with external APIs
-   Postgres database to store auth/sync-related configuration + cached data
-   Tooling to write & deploy developer-supplied integration code
-   SDKs, REST API & webhooks to access the data sync from external APIs
-   Admin console to manage & observe integrations
-   REST API to manage integrations programmatically
