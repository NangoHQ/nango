## 🕐 When should I use Nango?

Nango is a good fit for you if:

-   You want to build integrations fast
-   Pre-built solutions such as embedded iPaaS or unified APIs are too limiting for you
-   You want to minimize maintenance overhead in production

Nango was primarily built for SaaS products where integrations are core to the product experience: If your product (deeply) integrates with other SaaS products Nango is probably a good fit for you.

Nango has not been built for:

-   Automating internal workflows
-   Adding single sign-on login options

## 🙋‍♀️ Why is Nango open-source?

We believe every software should seamlessly integrate with the other softwares of its users. _integrations_ are core features in software products and as such are built by engineers.

Our mission at Nango is to make it easy for engineers to build these integrations into their products.

We do this with an open platform for product integrations.

Thanks to our open-source approach every engineer can contribute improvements to the platform for everyone:

- Contribute new [API configurations](/core-concepts#api-configurations) for OAuth flows & data syncs
- Share [API specific quirks](/integrations/all/salesforce#api-gotchas) with other developers
- [Report bugs on GitHub](https://nango.dev/repo) or directly contribute a fix as a pull request
- Request features and chat with the Nango team on the [Slack community](https://www.nango.dev/slack)
