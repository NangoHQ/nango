## ⭐ Nango at a glance

Nango is a new way to build product integrations:

-   as **powerful** as building yourself
-   as **fast** as buying a pre-built solution

It supports:

-   🔐 Managed auth
-   🔁 Bi-directional syncing
-   🚫 Rate-limits & retries
-   📄 Pagination
-   🧠 Strong typing with your custom data models
-   🪝 Webhooks
-   👀 Monitoring
-   📺 Admin console

You get full control over the business logic of your integration.  
We built the [hard infrastructure](/core-concepts#nango-infrastructure), so you don't have to.

## 👩‍💻 How it looks in my code

-   1-liner to start a new OAuth flow:

```js
nango.auth('github', '<user-id>');
```

-   1-liner to fetch structured objects from any external API:

```js
nango.github().issues('<user-id>');
```
