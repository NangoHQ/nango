## How _API configurations_ work in Nango

Contributing a new _API configuration_ means Nango users will be able to build integrations for this API.

The only required part of the configuration is related to authentication. The rest is optional and optimizes the developer experience of building integrations for this API (e.g. Proxy default base URL, pagination helper, rate-limit helper).

_API configurations_ take the form of short YAML entries, living in a single file called [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml). Most _API configurations_ only need to make use of 2-3 configuration keys, but in some cases you might need more.

## _API configuration_ options

```yaml
provider-slug: # Shorthand for the provider, ideally the provider's name. Must be unique. Kebab case.
    ##########
    # Mandatory fields
    ##########
    auth_mode: OAUTH2 # OAUTH1, OAUTH2, API_KEY or BASIC
    authorization_url: https://${connectionConfig.params.subdomain}.gitlab.com/oauth/authorize # (OAuth) The URL of the authorization page for the OAuth service (supports string interpolation)
    token_url: https://${connectionConfig.params.subdomain}.gitlab.com/oauth/token # (OAuth 2) The URL for the token request (supports string interpolation)

    # Proxy
    proxy:
        base_url: https://gitlab.example.com # Presets the base URL when using the Proxy (supports string interpolation, e.g. Salesforce).

    ##########
    # Optional fields
    ##########
    # Additional params
    authorization_params: # Additional parameters to pass along in the authorization step
        response_type: code
    token_params: # Additional parameters to pass along in the token request
        mycoolparam: value
    refresh_url: https://api.example.com/oauth/refresh # The URL to use for refreshing the access token (only if different from token_url)
    scope_separator: ',' # String to use to separate scopes. Defaults to ' ' (1 space) if not provided

    # Metadata capture
    redirect_uri_metadata:
        - subdomain # Save the 'subdomain' query parameter value returned in the Redirect URI (Connection Metadata)
    token_response_metadata:
        - scopes # Save the 'scopes' query parameter value returned in the token response (Connection Metadata)

    # Advanced
    token_expiration_buffer: 360 # In seconds. If omitted, tokens refresh if fetched within 15mins of expiration. This field overrides this buffer (e.g. for APIs with very-short-lived tokens).
```

<Note>_API configurations_ support parameters using string interpolation for dynamic URLs, etc.</Note>

<Note>
    You can configure some [connection metadata](/guides/oauth#connection-metadata), which is additional metadata that you want to capture during the OAuth flow and store in the _connection_.
</Note>

## Step-by-step guide to add an _API configuration_

### Step 1: Add your new provider to `providers.yaml`

Fork the repo and edit the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) file as explained
above to add support for the new API.

### Step 2: Test your new provider

To test your new provider, go to the `nango` folder root and run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

When you are ready to test your new _API configuration_:

**Add your client credentials to the local Nango Server**

Open the [local Dashboard](http://localhost:3003) in your browser and add a new
integration with your freshly added provider (it should show up in the provider
dropdown).

**Trigger the OAuth Flow**

Run an OAuth flow on the
[local Dashboard](http://localhost:3003/connection/create).

You can modify the ports in the docker compose if there are any conflicts with
other local services on your host machine.

**Check the access token in the dashboard**

If all goes well, you should see your new _connection_ in the
[Connections tab](http://localhost:3003/connections) in the dashboard.

Check the _connection_ details and make sure all looks as expected (access token,
refresh token, metadata).

### Step 3: Add your integration to the Documentation

Add a file named `<provider_slug>.mdx` (e.g. `github.md`) corresponding to your
new integration to the `docs-v2/integrations/all` folder. You can check out
[asana](/integrations/all/asana) for an example.

Also, add your new documentation page to `docs-v2/mint.json` in the `Supported APIs` group (in alphabetical order).

### Step 4: Submit your PR

Submit your PR with the new provider to the Nango repo. Please thoroughly test
the integration.

Thanks a lot for your contribution!! ❤️
