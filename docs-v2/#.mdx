## ⭐ Nango at a glance[](#-nango-at-a-glance "Direct link to ⭐ Nango at a glance")

Nango is a service that contains everything you need to work with APIs that use OAuth.

It contains:

* a full OAuth dance for 60+ APIs
* a frontend SDK to trigger new OAuth flows
* a backend SDK & REST API to retrieve fresh access tokens for your API calls

Nango is easy to try in 5 minutes and can be deployed in 15:

* 1-liner to start a new OAuth flow in your frontend:

```
let result = await nango.auth('github', '<user-id>');

```

* 1-liner to retrieve a fresh access token (with our SDK or REST API):

```
let token = await nango.getToken('github', '<user-id>');

```

## 🐻 History[](#-history "Direct link to 🐻 History")

Pizzly was originally developed by the team at [Bearer](https://www.bearer.com/?ref=pizzly) with contributions of more than 40+ individuals. Over time the focus of Bearer shifted and they could no longer maintain Pizzly. In late 2022 the team at [Nango](https://www.nango.dev) adopted the project and has since developed it together with the growing Nango community.
