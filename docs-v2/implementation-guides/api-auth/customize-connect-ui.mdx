description: "Guide to letting your users authorize an external API from your application, with your own UI."
---

The easiest way to let your users authorize an external API is with Nangoâ€™s pre-built **Connect UI**. Depending on your [plan](https://www.nango.dev/pricing), you can also customize your brand color and remove the _Secured by Nango_ watermark.

If you prefer full control, you can use Nango headlessly and **build your own authentication UI from scratch**.\
This guide walks you through the steps to do that.

<Info>
  Pre-requisites:

  - complete the [Configure an integration](/implementation-guides/api-auth/configure-integration) guide
  - generate a [Connect session token](/implementation-guides/api-auth/implement-api-auth#1-generate-a-session-token-backend)
</Info>

## Integrate the frontend SDK

In your frontend, initiate Nango ([reference](/reference/sdks/frontend#instantiate-the-frontend-sdk)):

```ts
import Nango from '@nangohq/frontend';

const nango = new Nango({ connectSessionToken: '<CONNECT-SESSION-TOKEN>' });
```

Initiate the authorization flow ([reference](/reference/sdks/frontend#collect-and-store-end-user-credentials)):

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="OAuth">
    For OAuth, the `nango.auth()` method will trigger the OAuth flow in a popup, to let the user log in to their external account.

    ```js
    nango
        .auth('<INTEGRATION-ID>')
        .then((result) => {
            // Show success UI.
        })
        .catch((error) => {
            // Show failure UI.
        });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API Key">
    For API keys, the `nango.auth()` method is used to store the end-user's API key (that you have previously collected from them).

    ```js
    nango
        .auth('<INTEGRATION-ID>', {
            credentials: {
                apiKey: '<END-USER-API-KEY>'
            }
        })
        .then((result) => {
            // Show success UI.
        })
        .catch((error) => {
            // Show failure UI.
        });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Basic Auth">
    For Basic Auth, the `nango.auth()` method is used to store the end-user's username & password (that you have previously collected from them).

    ```js
    nango
        .auth('<INTEGRATION-ID>', {
            credentials: {
                username: '<END-USER-API-KEY>',
                password: '<END-USER-PASSWORD>'
            }
        })
        .then((result) => {
            // Show success UI.
        })
        .catch((error) => {
            // Show failure UI.
        });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Handle APIs requiring connection-specific configuration for authorization

Some APIs require connection-specific configuration (e.g. Zendesk, Shopify).

For example, Zendesk has the following authorization URL, where the subdomain is specific to a user's Zendesk account:

`https://<USER-SUBDOMAIN>.zendesk.com/oauth/authorizations/new`

When using the [Connect UI](/implementation-guides/api-auth/implement-api-auth), this information is collected from the end user with an automatically-generated form.

But when using a custom UI, you must provide this configuration when calling `nango.auth()` ([reference](/reference/sdks/frontend#collect-and-store-end-user-credentials)):

```js
nango.auth('zendesk', {
    params: { subdomain: '<ZENDESK-SUBDOMAIN>' }
});
```

In some cases you might want to override the scopes provided by an integration at the connection level. For this case you can pass in the scopes to `nango.auth`:

```js
nango.auth('zendesk', {
    params: { oauth_scopes_override: 'custom-connection-scope' }
});
```

This _connection configuration_ is stored in the connection. You can retrieve it with the SDK ([reference](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials)) and API ([reference](/reference/api/connection/get)), or see it in connection details in the Nango UI.

Once the authorization succeeds, [_save the connection ID_](/implementation-guides/api-auth/implement-api-auth#3-listen-for-webhooks-%26-save-the-connection-id-backend).
