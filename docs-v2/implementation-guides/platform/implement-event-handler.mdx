## How to implement an event handler

### Step 1 - Initial Functions setup

If you don't have a `nango-integrations` folder yet, follow the [initial Functions setup guide](/implementation-guides/building-integrations/functions-setup) first.

Otherwise, you can skip to the next step.

### Step 2 - Create your event function file

Create a new file in your integration's folder, which should be nested unser your `nango-integrations` folder.

For example, if you want to react to an event in your `salesforce` integration, your folder structure should look like this:

```
nango-integrations/
├── .nango
├── .env
├── index.ts
├── package.json
└── salesforce # this is the integration id and must match an integration id in your Nango dashboard
    └── setup.ts # your new event handler function
```

Paste the following scaffold into the file:

```typescript setup.ts
import { createOnEvent } from 'nango';

export default createOnEvent({
    description: "<description of your event handler>",
    event: 'post-connection-creation' | 'pre-connection-deletion' | 'validate-connection', // event to trigger on
    exec: async (nango) => {
        // Your integration code goes here.
    }
});
```

The `exec` function kicks off when the associated event occurs.

Also import your new event file in your `index.ts` file:

```typescript index.ts
import './salesforce/setup';
```

### Step 3 - Implement the event function

Implement your handler logic in the `exec` function.

The following can help you with your implementation:
- [`nango` object reference](/reference/functions) to understand the SDK methods available in event functions
- [Our reference implementations repo](https://www.nango.dev/templates) has many examples of event handlers. Search for `onEvent(`.
- [Leveraging AI agents guide](/implementation-guides/building-integrations/leverage-ai-agents) to build actions with claude code, cursor & other AI agents

### Step 4 - Deploy your integrations

To run your event function in Nango, you need to deploy it to an environment in your Nango account.

To deploy all integrations in your `nango-integrations` folder, run:
```bash
nango deploy dev # dev is the name of the environment to which you are deploying
```

Currently it's not possible to deploy specific event functions, or to test the them locally.
