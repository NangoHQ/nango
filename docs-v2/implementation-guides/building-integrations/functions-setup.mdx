To work with Nango Functions, you need the Nango CLI and `nango-integrations` folder set up.

## Install the Nango CLI

Install the Nango CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g nango
```

Type `nango help` to get an overview of all CLI functions or take a look at the [CLI reference](/reference/cli).

## Create your `nango-integrations` folder

All your integrations live in a folder called `nango-integrations`. Whether located in your main codebase or a dedicated repository, this folder should be version-controlled.

To initialize your integrations folder (e.g., at the root of your repository), run:
```bash
nango init nango-integrations
```

<Note>
    You can also ask Nango to seed your `nango-integrations` folder with instructions for AI agents:

    ```bash
    nango init --ai cursor
    ```

    For more details, read our [guide to leveraging AI agents](/implementation-guides/building-integrations/leverage-ai-agents)

</Note>

This creates the `./nango-integrations` folder with some initial configuration and an example sync script. The `nango-integrations` directory looks like this:
```
nango-integrations/
├── .nango
├── .env
├── index.ts
├── package.json
└── demo-github-integration # this is the integration unique ID and must match an integration ID in your Nango UI
    └── syncs/
        └── github-issue-example.ts
```

## Authenticate the CLI

In an `.env` file in `./nango-integrations`, add the following environment variables:
```bash
NANGO_SECRET_KEY_PROD='<PROD-SECRET-KEY>'
NANGO_SECRET_KEY_DEV='<DEV-SECRET-KEY>'
```

Get your secret keys from the **Environment Settings** tab (toggle between the `Production` and `Development` environment in the left nav bar).

## Next steps

Take a look at the example `github-issues-example` sync.

You can also find more examples in our [reference implementations repo](https://www.nango.dev/templates) on GitHub.

When you are ready, remove the example integration and create your own function:
