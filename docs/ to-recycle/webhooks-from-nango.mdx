Nango uses webhooks to notify your application of important events.

<Info>
    This page talks about webhooks Nango sends to your own application.
    To process webhooks from external APIs, please read the [Webhooks](/implementation-guides/use-cases/webhooks-from-external-apis) page.

## Webhooks Configuration

Each [environment](/guides/platform/environments) in Nango has its own webhook settings:
- Which webhooks Nango sends to your application
- Endpoints the webhooks are sent to

Nango currently sends all webhooks to the same endpoint. You can configure up to two endpoints per environment that will receive webhooks.

Failed webhook deliveries are retried several times, with exponential backoff. All webhook delivery attempts are logged in Nango's [logs](/guides/platform/observability).

To receive webhooks from Nango in your app, follow our [Webhooks from Nango implementation guide](/implementation-guides/platform/webhooks-from-nango).

## Overview of Nango webhooks

The most popular webhooks are:
- New connection created: Sent whenever a new [connection](/guides/primitives/auth#overview) has been created in the environment
- Sync execution finished: Sent whenever a [Sync](/implementation-guides/use-cases/syncs/implement-a-sync) execution finishes
- Forwarded webhook: Sent when you instruct Nango to forward [webhooks from an external API](/implementation-guides/use-cases/webhooks-from-external-apis) to your app
