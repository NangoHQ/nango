### OAuth token refresh & validity

If the external API requires OAuth access tokens to be refreshed, Nango will do this automatically for you before the token expires. If the refresh fails, it can [inform your app with a webhook](/guides/platform/webhooks-from-nango), and you can ask the user to reconnect.

Some APIs revoke refresh tokens that are unused. To avoid this, Nango refreshes each access token at least once every 24h.

Revoked access tokens, and refresh failures, happen to all integrations. Read our [best practice guide on handling revoked access tokens](/implementation-guides/platform/common-issues#token-refresh-error-from-the-external-api) and make sure you [implement the re-authentication flow](/implementation-guides/api-auth/implement-api-auth#6-re-authorize-an-existing-connection) so your users can re-authenticate broken connections.
