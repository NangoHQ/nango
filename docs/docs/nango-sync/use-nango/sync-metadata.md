# Attach metadata to Syncs

You can attach arbitrary metadata to each synced row using the `metadata` field in the [Sync config options](sync-all-options.md). 

This is useful if you want to query the synced data based on fields from your other SQL tables (e.g. `user_id`, `company_id`, etc.).

## Problems with your Sync? We are here to help!

If you need help or run into issues, please reach out! We are online and responsive all day on the [Slack Community](https://nango.dev/slack).
