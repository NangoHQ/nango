## Using Ramp with Nango

Provider template name in Nango: `ramp`  
Follow our [quickstart](../quickstart.md) to add an OAuth integration with Ramp in 5 minutes.

## App registration & publishing

To register an OAuth app it seems you need a Ramp account.
As a workaround you can use the [sandbox access form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddatpB56ClpJnrPdhgqApvxH_tQdeAcbEFqki-ftPMRrmX7g/viewform) (link mentioned [here](https://docs.ramp.com/developer-api/v1/overview/getting-started)) to get in touch with the Ramp team and ask for a dev account.
