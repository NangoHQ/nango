## Using Google Calendar with Nango

Google Calendar uses the same OAuth mechanism as other Google services. Please use the Google template for it in Nango: `google`  
Follow our [quickstart](../quickstart.md) to add an OAuth integration with the Google Calendar API in 5 minutes.

## App registration & publishing

Google's APIs all use the same OAuth service. To which APIs you get access is determined by the scopes that you request.

Please check the main [Google OAuth API wiki](google.md) here for details on how to register an OAuth app with Google.
