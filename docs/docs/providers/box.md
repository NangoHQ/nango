## App registration & publishing

**Rating: `Easy & fast`**
Registering an app takes only a few minutes and you can start building immediately. If you don't have one already, create a free [Box account](https://box.com). Then go to the [Box Developer console](https://app.box.com/developers/console) and create a new OAuth 2.0 app.
