- Zoho uses datacenter-specific URLs for authentication. Make sure to use the correct datacenter domain extension (`com`, `eu`, `in`, `com.cn`, `com.au`) based on where your user's account is registered.
- For production applications, consider implementing [multi-datacenter support](https://www.zoho.com/accounts/protocol/oauth/multi-dc.html) to handle users from different regions.
- For specific scopes, refer to the API documentation pages to find the exact scopes needed per API and per method.
