# Overview

To authenticate with CrowdStrike, you need:
1. **Client ID** - A unique identifier for your API client.
2. **Client Secret** - A confidential key used to authenticate the identity of the application (client).
3. **Base URL** - The API base URL for your CrowdStrike cloud environment.

This guide will walk you through obtaining these credentials within CrowdStrike.

### Prerequisites:
