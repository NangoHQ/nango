# Overview

To authenticate with ConnectWise RMM, you need:
1. **API Hostname** - The region-specific OpenAPI hostname for your tenant
2. **Scope** - OAuth scope(s) required for the endpoints you plan to call
3. **Client ID** - Your OAuth client ID
4. **Client Secret** - Your OAuth client secret

### Prerequisites:

- Access to your ConnectWise RMM tenant as an administrator.
- Permission to create or manage API credentials.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Find your API hostname

Use the hostname that matches your tenant region:

- US: `openapi.service.itsupport247.net`
- EU: `openapi.service.euplatform.connectwise.com`
- AU: `openapi.service.auplatform.connectwise.com`

### Step 2: Create API credentials

In your ConnectWise RMM tenant:

1. Open the API/integration settings for your tenant.
2. Create (or reuse) an OAuth client that supports the Client Credentials flow.
3. Copy the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

<Note>
Store the Client Secret securely. If your admin portal only shows it once, save it in a secret manager immediately.
</Note>

### Step 3: Select your OAuth scopes

Grant the scopes required by your use case. For example:

- `platform.companies.read` for listing companies
- `platform.devices.read` for device-oriented endpoints

You can provide one or more scopes in Nango's **Scope** field.

### Step 4: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with ConnectWise RMM.
2. Enter:
   - **API Hostname**
   - **Scope**
   - **Client ID**
   - **Client Secret**
3. Submit the form. Nango will request tokens from `https://<API-HOSTNAME>/v1/token` and store/refresh them for you.

You are now connected to ConnectWise RMM.
