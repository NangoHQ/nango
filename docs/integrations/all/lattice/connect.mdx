# Overview

To authenticate with both Lattice, you need one key piece of information:
1. **API Key** - Your Lattice API Key


This guide will walk you through generating your API key within Lattice.


### Prerequisites:

- You need to have an admin account to access Lattice API Key. If you don't, you can sign up [here](https://lattice.zendesk.com/auth/v2/login/registration?auth_origin=360005592414%2Ctrue%2Ctrue&brand_id=360005592414&return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.lattice.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360059449534-Lattice-s-Public-API&theme=hc)

- If it's your first time accessing the API key, you will need to request API access from Lattice by writting them an [email](mailto:request-api-access@lattice.com) answering this questions:
    - What is your intended use case with the API?
    - Will it be used with a third-party software tool? If yes, please specify the tool.

- Once approved, you can create or revoke API keys without needing to request additional approval.
