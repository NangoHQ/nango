## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request a Sandbox Account">
    1. Log in to your [sandbox](https://hcm-demo.paycor.com/) account.
    2. Navigate to the Support form.
    3. From the **Category dropdown**, select `Sandbox Environment`.
    4. Submit the request.
    > **Note**: The expected turnaround time for Sandbox environment creation is 5 business days.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accessing the Sandbox Environment">
    Once your Sandbox account is approved:
    1. Navigate to [developers-sandbox.paycor.com](https://developers-sandbox.paycor.com/).
    2. Click **Sign Up** on the home screen for existing Paycor Clients.
    3. Click **Get Started**.
    4. Enter your sandbox Username and Password.
    5. Click **Sign In**.
    6. Select whom you would like to be the Admin of the Developer Portal Account.
    7. Click **Request Access**.
    8. Sign out then Sign In again using your previously used credentials.

    > **Note**: The account creation process can take up to 5 minutes to complete. Sign out, then sign back in to access Paycor's sandbox Developer Portal.
    The Sandbox API base URL is different from Production (e.g., https://apis-sandbox.paycor.com/v1/...) and allows testing with mock data before moving to Production.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build your application">
    1. Click **Applications** on the home screen to get started.
    2. Click the **+ Application** button to create a new application, enter your application name.
    3. Select an **Application Type**: **Standard Application**: For general API access.
    4. Click **Create Application**
    5. **Copy & Save** the **Application OAuth Client ID** and **Application OAuth Client Secret** as you will need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
    6. Click **Got it**
    7. Navigate to the **Security Connections** tab to get your **API Subscription Key** (you will need to add this to your Nango connection configuration) and add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` as the **Approved Return OAuth URL**.
    8. Navigate to the **Data Access** tab and select your required Access scopes. This will generate a new version of the scope. You can find the **Scope Name** in the **General** tab, which you will need when configuring your integration in Nango.

## API gotchas

- **Scope Name Generation**: After selecting your required Access scopes in the Data Access tab, Paycor generates a new version of the scope. You can find the **Scope Name** in the **General** tab, which you must add to your Nango Paycor integration configuration.
- **Subscription Key Required**: You need to add your **API Subscription Key** (found in the Security Connections tab) as a connection configuration parameter in Nango for all API calls to work properly. See [creating a connect session documentation](/reference/api/connect/sessions/create#body-integrations-config-defaults) for details on how to add `subscriptionKey` to your `connection_config` when creating a Nango session.
