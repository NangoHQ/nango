# Overview

To authenticate with AWS-IAM, you will need:
1. **Access Key ID** - This is a unique identifier that specifies the IAM user or role making the request.
2. **Secret Access Key** - This is a confidential key that acts as a password used to sign API requests made to AWS IAM services.

This guide will walk you through finding the API Key within AWS IAM.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a registered account with AWS.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding Your pair keys
1. **Log in** to your AWS IAM console.
2. In the navigation bar on the upper right, select your user name, and then select **Security credentials**.

3. In the **Access keys** section, click **Create access key**. If you already have two access keys, this button is deactivated and you must delete an access key before you can create a new one.

4. On the **Access key best practices & alternatives** page, choose your use case to learn about additional options which can help you avoid creating a long-term access key. If you determine that your use case still requires an access key, click **Other** and then click **Next**.
5. Once you are done, a pair of both **Access** and **Secret Access** keys will be generated.

#### Step 2: Finding Your region host
1. You can obtain this directly from the web address bar.

#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have these keys and the region:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with AWS-IAM.
2. Enter the **Access Key ID**, **Secret Access Key**, and **Region** in their respective fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
