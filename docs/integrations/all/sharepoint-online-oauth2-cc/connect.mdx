# Overview

To authenticate with SharePoint Online (Client Credentials V2), you need:
1. **Tenant ID** - The unique identifier for your organization that uses Microsoft services.
2. **Client ID** - The unique identifier that Azure assigns to your application when it's registered.
3. **Client Secret** - A unique string that enables the client application to access SharePoint Online.

This guide will walk you through generating and finding these credentials within Azure.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an Azure account with an active SharePoint Online subscription.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding your Tenant ID
1. Your Tenant ID can be found in the **Tenant ID** field on the [Overview page](https://aad.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview) within your Azure account.

#### Step 3: Generating your Client Secret
1. After registering a new app in the [step](#step-2-generating-your-client-id) above, you can now generate a client secret for that specific application. Navigate to **Certificates & secrets** under **Manage**, and click **New client secret**.
2. A pop-up modal will appear, prompting you to enter your secret's **Description** and **Expires** values. Fill these then click on **Add**.

3. Once completed, your **Client Secret** will be generated. This value can be found in the **Value** field within the **Client Secrets** table.

4. After generating the **Client Secret**, you must grant the registered application the necessary permissions for **SharePoint Online**. To do this, navigate to **API permissions**, select **Add a permission**, and choose **Microsoft Graph**.
5. Select **Application permissions**, choose the required permissions, and then click **Add permissions**.
