# Overview

To authenticate with NinjaOne RMM, you need:
1. **Client ID** – Your OAuth application's Client ID
2. **Client Secret** – Your OAuth application's Client Secret
3. **Scopes** – The access scopes for your application (optional, defaults to all)

This guide walks you through creating an OAuth Client Application in NinjaOne RMM.

### Prerequisites:

- Admin access to your NinjaOne RMM tenant.

### Step 1: Create an OAuth Client Application

1. Log in to your NinjaOne instance at `https://app.ninjarmm.com`.
2. Navigate to **Administration** > **Apps** > **API**.

3. Click on the **Client App IDs** tab.
4. Click the **Add** button to open the Application Configuration form.
5. Select **API Services (machine-to-machine)** as the Application Platform.

6. Select the necessary scopes based on your needs:
   - **Monitoring**: Read-only access to monitoring data and organization structure
   - **Management**: Modify device and organization information
   - **Control**: Enable remote access via API

7. Ensure **Client Credentials** is selected in Allowed Grant Types.
8. Click **Add** to create the application. You may have to perform a
   multi-factor authentication step in order to finish adding your new
   application.


### Step 2: Copy your credentials

1. After creating the application, the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be displayed.
2. **Important**: Copy and securely store both values immediately. The Client Secret is only shown once and cannot be retrieved later.

### Step 3: Enter your details in the Connect UI

Once you have the credentials:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with NinjaOne RMM.
2. Enter the **Client ID** in the appropriate field.
3. Enter the **Client Secret** in the appropriate field.
4. (Optional) Enter specific scopes if you don't want all available scopes. Leave empty for default access.
5. Submit the form to complete the authentication.

You are now connected to NinjaOne RMM.

## Scopes

NinjaOne RMM supports three main scopes: `monitoring`, `management`, and `control`.

Contrary to NinjaOne RMM's documentation, you _must_ specify at least one valid scope in order to successfully authenticate to
NinjaOne RMM's API.
