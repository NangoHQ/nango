## API gotchas

- When adding a new connection, you will also need to add your `environmentUrl`, this can be the link to your private instance of Make, for example, `development.make.cloud`, or the link to Make (with or without the zone, depending on a specific endpoint), for example, `eu1.make.com`. For more details, check [API structure](https://www.make.com/en/api-documentation/api-structure).
