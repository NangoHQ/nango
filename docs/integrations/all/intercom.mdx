## API gotchas

-   Intercom access tokens do not expire. Logically, Intercom doesn't return a refresh token along with the access token.
-   You do not need to pass API scopes/permissions during the authorization request. Permissions are only set in the Intercom Developer Portal.
-   Intercom has [rate limits](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/references/rest-api/errors/rate-limiting) that vary by endpoint and plan type.
-   When working with the Intercom API, be aware that some endpoints require specific permissions that must be enabled in your app's configuration.
