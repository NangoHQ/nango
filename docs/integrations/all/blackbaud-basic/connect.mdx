# Overview

To authenticate with Blackbaud (Basic Auth), you need:
1. **Host Name** -  Your Blackbaud environment URL for API access.
1. **Username** -  Your unique account identifier used for authentication.
2. **Password** -  A key used in combination with the username for API authentication. 

This guide will walk you through finding or generating these credentials within Blackbaud.

### Prerequisites:

The following prerequisites are only required when you opt for authenticating API requests with the **Username and PAT** option.
- To add a proxy user, you must have system role administrator rights.
- You must also be signed in with the Blackbaud ID you wish to link the proxy user to.

#### Step 1: Finding your Host Name
1. Log in to your application as you normally would.
2. Once logged in, look at the URL in your browser’s address bar.
3. Copy the entire URL up to `/webui/` For example if the url is `http://localhost/bbappfx/webui/webshellpage.aspx?databasename=BBInfinity`, the **Host Name** would be `http://localhost/bbappfx`.

#### Step 2: Finding your Password
- This is the password you use to log into your Infinity account.  
- The following steps are for users who prefer to authenticate their API requests with a proxy user PAT instead of their Infinity login password.

<Note>When you add a proxy user, the user automatically inherits the same system roles as its proxy owner. You can remove roles from the proxy user at any time.</Note>
1. From Administration, **Application Users**, select **Add proxy user**.
2. Enter a unique **username** and save. Be sure to copy this **username**, as it will be required later.

#### Step 3: Finding your Username
- This is the **username** you use to log into your Infinity account.  
- If you prefer using your proxy user PAT, please use the username from the unique **username** saved from [step 2](#step-2-finding-your-password) above. 

#### Step 4: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Host Name**, **Username** and **Password**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Blackbaud (Basic Auth).
2. Enter your **Host Name**, **Username** and **Password** in their designated fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
