# Overview

To authenticate with Datadog, you need three key pieces of information:
1. **API Key** - Your Datadog API Key
2. **Site Parameter** - Location of your datadog host
3. **Application Key** - Keys are associated with the user account that created


This guide will walk you through finding or creating those credentials within Datadog.


### Prerequisites:

- You must set up an account with Datadog.


#### Step 1: Finding Your Datadog Domain
1. Log in to your Datadog account. 


2. You can identify which site (Site Parameter) you are on by matching your Datadog website URL (in your browser) to one of the following:

| Site     | Site URL                     | Site Parameter       | Location      |
|----------|-------------------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| US1      | [https://app.datadoghq.com](https://app.datadoghq.com)         | datadoghq.com       | US            |
| US3      | [https://us3.datadoghq.com](https://us3.datadoghq.com)         | us3.datadoghq.com   | US            |
| US5      | [https://us5.datadoghq.com](https://us5.datadoghq.com)         | us5.datadoghq.com   | US            |
| EU1      | [https://app.datadoghq.eu](https://app.datadoghq.eu)           | datadoghq.eu        | EU (Germany)  |
| US1-FED  | [https://app.ddog-gov.com](https://app.ddog-gov.com)           | ddog-gov.com        | US            |
| AP1      | [https://ap1.datadoghq.com](https://ap1.datadoghq.com)         | ap1.datadoghq.com   | Japan         |


#### Step 2: Datadog API Key
1. To add a Datadog API key, Navigate to **Organization settings**, then click the **API keys** tab.
- Click the **New Key** or **New Client Token** button, depending on which youâ€™re creating
- Enter a name for your key and then click **Create API key**

Note:
- Your org must have at least one API key and at most 50 API keys.
- Key names must be unique across your organization.


#### Step 3: Datadog Application Key
1. To create a new application key, navigate to **Organization Settings** > **Application Keys**. If you have the permission to create application keys, click **New Key**.

2. Enter an alias for the API Key for easy identification.

Note:
- Application key names cannot be blank.
- Securely copy your API and application keys

3. Optional step: On the same modal, click on "Edit scopes". In the "Select scopes" modal, select the scopes you want to grant to the application key,
 we recommend selecting `user_access_manage` and `user_access_read` if you want to use existing Nango Datadog integration. If left blank, the application key
 will mirror the scopes of the user account that created it.

#### Step 4: Connect Your Datadog Account

To authenticate using your API credentials, navigate to the Datadog authentication form.
Enter your credentials as follows:
- API Key: Your API key
- Site Parameter: Your datadog host
- Application Key: Your application key

Click "Connect" to complete the authentication.
