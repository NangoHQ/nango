# Overview

To authenticate with Totango, you need:
1. **App Token** - A personal access token that grants Nango permission to interact with Totango's API resources and services.
2. **Service ID** - A unique identifier for your Totango service.

This guide will walk you through obtaining your App Token and Service ID within Totango.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an account with Totango.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding Your App Token

1. Log in to your [Totango](https://app.totango.com/) account.
2. Click your profile icon and choose **Edit Profile**.
3. From the **Integration** tab, click **Create Token**.
4. In the **New Token Details** window, enter the following details:
   - **Token Name**: Choose a name to identify the token among others within your profile.
   - **Expiration Time**: Choose from 7, 30, 60, 90 days, no expiration, or custom.
5. Click **Generate Token**.
6. Copy the generated token - it will be available to copy and paste directly into the third-party system.
7. Click **Close**.

<Note>
Personal access tokens are intended for personal use when writing scripts/applications that access Totango API. Protect them as you protect your password, as they provide the same access to your user account. Do not share them with anyone.
</Note>

#### Step 2: Finding Your Service ID

1. From within Totango, click your profile icon.
2. Make note of the service information, which is built out of three parts: **[SP]-[Account Number]-[Instance] = Service ID**.
3. In the following example, `SP-234164-01` is the service ID.
4. **Important**: For the Nango integration, use only the middle number from your Service ID. For example, if your Service ID is `SP-234164-01`, use `234164`.

#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **App Token** and **Service ID**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Totango.
2. Enter your **App Token** in the App Token field.
3. Enter your **Service ID** (middle number only) in the Service ID field.
4. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.

You are now connected to Totango.
