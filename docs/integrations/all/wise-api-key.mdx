## Setup guide

Use this integration if you're a small business user automating your own Wise account. No partnership required.

### Step 1: Generate API Token

1. Go to [wise.com](https://wise.com) and log in
2. Select your **Business profile**
3. Navigate to: **Your Account → Integrations and Tools → API tokens**
4. Click **Add new Token**
5. Complete 2-step verification
6. Copy the generated token

<Warning>
Keep your API token secure. It provides access to your Wise account.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Configure Nango

Use your Personal API Token to configure the Wise (API Key) integration in Nango.

## API gotchas

-   **Business Account Required**: Personal API tokens are generated from a Wise Business profile.
-   **Limited API Access**: Personal tokens have more limited API access compared to OAuth credentials.
-   **PSD2 Restrictions (EU/UK)**: Due to PSD2 regulations, you **cannot** fund transfers or view balance statements via API with a personal token in the EU/UK.
-   **Single User**: A personal token authenticates requests for a single Wise.com user only.
-   **When to Use OAuth Instead**: If you're building for end customers or need full API access, you should use OAuth (requires Wise partnership).
