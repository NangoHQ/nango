# Overview

To finish connecting an AWS SigV4 integration, you (the end customer) need:

1. **Access to your AWS account** – enough permission to deploy the CloudFormation template (or equivalent) your vendor provides.
2. **The IAM Role ARN** created by that template, which trusts your vendor's AWS account.
3. (Optional) **A region override** if you want this connection to run in a different AWS region than the default advertised by the vendor.

### Prerequisites

-   Run the CloudFormation template (or follow the manual instructions) surfaced in the Connect UI so the trusted role exists in your account.
-   Copy the full IAM Role ARN that the template outputs.

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Run the vendor-provided setup link

1. Click the **Open setup instructions** button or one of the CloudFormation template buttons provided in the Connect UI.
2. Follow the vendor's steps to deploy the CloudFormation stack in your AWS account.
3. After the stack finishes, copy the IAM Role ARN from the stack outputs or from the IAM console.

#### Step 2: Provide the Role ARN

1. Return to the Connect form.
2. Paste the IAM Role ARN into the **IAM Role ARN** field exactly as it appears in AWS (for example `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/NangoAccessRole`).

#### Step 3: Enter connection details

1. If the vendor asked you to use a specific AWS region, enter it in the **AWS Region (optional)** field (e.g., `us-east-1`). Leave it empty to use the vendor’s default region.
2. Submit the form. Nango will validate the role by assuming it via AWS STS (or the vendor’s custom STS endpoint).

Once the form succeeds, the integration owner can begin proxying requests to AWS services on your behalf.

You are now connected to the AWS SigV4 Proxy integration.
