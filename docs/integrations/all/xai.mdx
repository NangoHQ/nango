## API gotchas

- API requests are rate-limited per tier; exceeding limits returns a 429 error—monitor usage to avoid disruptions and consider upgrading for higher quotas. For more on this please visit, [Usage, Tiers and Rate Limits](https://docs.x.ai/docs/usage-tiers-and-rate-limits#usage-tiers-and-rate-limits)
