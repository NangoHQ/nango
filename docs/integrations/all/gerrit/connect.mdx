# Overview

To authenticate with Gerrit, you will need:
1. **Gerrit Host** - The location to where you Gerrit instance is currently hosted.
2. **User Name** - The User Name associated with your Gerrit account, used to authenticate API requests.
3. **Password** - The password linked to your Gerrit account, required for secure authentication.


This guide will walk you through finding your Gerrit **Host** and **credentials**.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have your Gerrit instance installed and running on your host.
- Ensure you have valid credentials (username and password) to access the Gerrit API.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding Your Host
- Your Host is the URL where your Gerrit instance is running. For example:
`https://your-gerrit-domain`
- If you’re hosting Gerrit locally, the host URL might look like:
`http://localhost:8080`
- Ensure the Gerrit server is accessible from the network where you’re setting up the connection.

#### Step 2: Obtain Your Credentials
- Use your **username** and **password** to authenticate. These are the credentials you use to log in to your Gerrit account.

#### Step 3: Enter host and credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Host**, **User name**, and **Password**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Gerrit.
2. Enter the **Host**, **User Name** and **Password** in their respective fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
