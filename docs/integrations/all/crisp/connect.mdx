# Overview

To authenticate with Crisp, you need:
1. **Token Identifier** - The identifier part of your Crisp token keypair that authenticates your requests.
2. **Token Key** - The key part of your Crisp token keypair that authenticates your requests.

This guide will walk you through generating your token keypair in the Crisp Marketplace.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a Crisp account.
- You need access to the Crisp Marketplace (this account is different from your main Crisp account).

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Generating Your Token Keypair

1. Go to the [Crisp Marketplace](https://marketplace.crisp.chat/) and sign in or create an account.
2. Once logged in, go to **Plugins** and click on the **New Plugin** button.
