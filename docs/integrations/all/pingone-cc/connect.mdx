# Overview

To authenticate with PingOne (Client Credentials), you need:
1. **Client ID** - The unique identifier for your Worker app.
2. **Client Secret** - A confidential key used to authenticate the identity of your Worker app.
3. **Environment ID** - The unique identifier (UUID) for your PingOne environment.
4. **Top Level Domain** - The regional domain extension for your PingOne instance (e.g., `com`, `eu`, `asia`, `ca`)

This guide will walk you through creating a Worker app and obtaining all the necessary credentials within PingOne.
