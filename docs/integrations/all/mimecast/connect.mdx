# Overview

To authenticate with Mimecast, you need:
1. **Client ID** – Your Mimecast API 2.0 application's Client ID
2. **Client Secret** – Your Mimecast API 2.0 application's Client Secret

This guide walks you through creating an API 2.0 application in Mimecast Cloud Gateway.

### Prerequisites:

- Admin access to your Mimecast Administration Console.
- Access to the Cloud Gateway section.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Navigate to API Applications

1. Log in to your Mimecast Administration Console.
2. Navigate to **Administration** > **Services** > **Cloud Gateway**.
3. Select **API and Platform Integrations** > **API 2.0 Applications**.

#### Step 2: Generate API Keys

1. In the Mimecast API 2.0 section, click **Generate Keys**.

2. Configure your application:
   - **Application Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your integration
   - **Application Description**: Provide details about what this integration will do
   - **Authentication Type**: Select **Client Credentials** (OAuth 2.0)
3. Select the appropriate **API permissions/scopes** that your integration requires based on the Mimecast APIs you plan to use.
4. Click **Create** or **Save** to register the application.

#### Step 3: Copy your credentials

1. After creating the application, the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be displayed.

2. **Important**: Copy and securely store both values immediately in a credentials vault. The Client Secret is only displayed once during the registration/configuration process and cannot be retrieved later.
3. If you lose the Client Secret, you will need to regenerate it or create a new application.

#### Step 4: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Mimecast.
2. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in their respective fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.

You are now connected to Mimecast.

### Additional Information

- **Token Expiration**: Access tokens obtained through the Client Credentials flow have a Time To Live (TTL) of 30 minutes. Nango will automatically refresh the token when it expires.
- **Security Best Practices**: Store your Client ID and Client Secret securely. Never commit these credentials to source control or expose them in client-side code.
