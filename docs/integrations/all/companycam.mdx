## API gotchas

-   This integration uses API_KEY auth mode with `Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}` in the request header to access different endpoints.
-   The API_KEY based auth mode should be enough for company-wide access.
-   CompanyCam also supports OAUTH2 auth mode which is not supported by this integration, because access is granted on a case-by-case basis by CompanyCam.
