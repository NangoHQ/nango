# Overview

To authenticate with OneLogin using OAuth2 Client Credentials, you need:
1. **Subdomain** - Your OneLogin account subdomain.
2. **Client ID** - A unique identifier for your API Credential Pair.
3. **Client Secret** - A confidential key used to authenticate your API Credential Pair.

This guide will walk you through generating these credentials within OneLogin.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a OneLogin account with administrator access.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding Your Subdomain

1. Log in to your OneLogin account.
2. Look at the browserâ€™s address bar at the top of the page.
3. Your **Subdomain** is the value between `https://` and `.onelogin.com`. If you're logged in and the URL in your browser is: `https://acme.onelogin.com/portal`, your subdomain is `acme`.


#### Step 2: Generating API Credentials

1. Log in to your OneLogin Admin Console as an account owner or administrator.
2. Navigate to **Developers** > **API Credentials**.

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with OneLogin.
2. Enter your **Subdomain**, **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in their respective fields. 
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
