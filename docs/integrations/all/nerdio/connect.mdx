# Overview

To authenticate with Nerdio, you need:
1. **Nerdio Instance URL** - The hostname of your Nerdio Manager instance
2. **Azure Tenant ID** - Your Azure Active Directory Tenant ID
3. **Client ID** - The Application (client) ID from your Azure App Registration
4. **Client Secret** - The client secret from your Azure App Registration
5. **API Scope** - The Application ID URI scope for the Nerdio API

This guide walks you through enabling the REST API in Nerdio Manager and obtaining the required credentials.

### Prerequisites:

- Admin access to your Nerdio Manager installation (Premium edition required)
- Access to your Azure Portal with permissions to manage App Registrations

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding your Nerdio Instance URL

1. Log in to your Nerdio Manager portal.
2. Copy the hostname from your browser's address bar (e.g., `web-admin-portal-xxxxx.azurewebsites.net`).

#### Step 2: Getting your Azure Credentials

1. In Nerdio Manager, navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations**.
2. In the **REST API** tile, if the Current status is Disabled, select **Disabled** to enable it.
3. In Step #1, select **Run**. This creates a new Azure application under the nerdio-nmw-app app registration in your Azure tenant.
4. In Step #2, select **Grant** to navigate to your Azure portal and grant Admin consent.

5. Once enabled, copy the following values from the **REST API Credentials** section:
   - **Client ID** - The Application (client) ID
   - **Tenant ID** - Your Azure AD Tenant ID

6. To generate a Client Secret:
   - Navigate to your Azure Portal > **App Registrations** > select the Nerdio app
   - Go to **Certificates & secrets** > **New client secret**
   - Copy the secret value immediately (it will only be shown once)

<Note>
Store the Client Secret securely immediately. It cannot be retrieved later. If you lose it, you will need to generate a new one.
</Note>

#### Step 3: Configuring the API Scope

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to your Nerdio App Registration.
2. Go to **Expose an API** and copy the **Application ID URI**.
3. Append `/.default` to the URI to form the complete scope (e.g., `api://your-app-id/.default`).

<Note>
If the Application ID URI is not set, you need to add it first. An example format is `api://g0cb288e-ff16-1861-9393-50219a19453c`.
</Note>

#### Step 4: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have gathered all credentials:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Nerdio.
2. Enter your **Nerdio Instance URL** (hostname only, without https://).
3. Enter your **Azure Tenant ID**.
4. Enter your **API Scope**.
5. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
6. Submit the form to authenticate.

You are now connected to Nerdio.

### Additional Information

- **Token Expiration**: Access tokens obtained through the Client Credentials flow typically have a TTL of 1 hour. Nango will automatically refresh the token when it expires.
- **API Documentation**: The Nerdio Manager API documentation can be found under **Settings** > **Integrations** > **REST API** in your Nerdio portal.
- **Security Best Practices**: Store your Client ID and Client Secret securely. Never commit these credentials to source control or expose them in client-side code.
