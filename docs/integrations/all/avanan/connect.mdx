# Overview

To authenticate with Avanan, you need:
1. **API Region** - The regional API endpoint for your Avanan tenant
2. **Application ID** - Your Avanan API Client ID
3. **Secret Key** - Your Avanan API Secret Key

This guide walks you through obtaining API credentials from the Avanan (Check Point Harmony Email & Collaboration) portal.

### Prerequisites:

- Admin access to your Avanan / Check Point Infinity Portal.
- Your organization must have SmartAPI access enabled.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Determine your region

1. Log in to your Check Point Infinity Portal at [portal.checkpoint.com](https://portal.checkpoint.com).
2. Identify your regional API endpoint based on your tenant location:

| Region | API Endpoint Value |
| - | - |
| USA | `smart-api-production-1-us` |
| Europe | `smart-api-production-1-eu` |
| Canada | `smart-api-production-1-ca` |
| Australia | `smart-api-production-5-ap` |
| United Kingdom | `smart-api-production-1-euw2` |
| UAE | `smart-api-production-1-mec1` |
| India | `smart-api-production-1-aps1` |

<Note>
If you're unsure which region your tenant is in, contact your Check Point account representative or check your Infinity Portal URL.
</Note>

#### Step 2: Create API credentials

1. In the Infinity Portal, navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys** or the SmartAPI configuration section.
2. Click **Create New API Key** or **Generate Credentials**.
3. Provide a name for your API integration (e.g., "Nango Integration").
4. Once created, you will receive:
   - **Application ID (Client ID)**: A unique identifier for your API application
   - **Secret Key**: A secret key used for authentication

<Note>
Copy and securely store both values immediately. The Secret Key may only be displayed once during creation and cannot be retrieved later. If you lose the Secret Key, you will need to generate new credentials.
</Note>

#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your credentials:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Avanan.
2. Select your **API Region** from the dropdown or enter the regional endpoint value.
3. Enter your **Application ID** and **Secret Key** in their respective fields.
4. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.

You are now connected to Avanan.

### Additional Information

- **Authentication Flow**: Avanan uses signature-based authentication. The Nango integration stores your credentials securely and passes the Application ID to API requests via the `x-av-app-id` header.
- **Token Management**: After initial authentication via the `/auth` endpoint, you'll receive a token that is valid for API requests. Tokens typically expire after 30 minutes.
- **Security Best Practices**: Store your Application ID and Secret Key securely. Never commit these credentials to source control or expose them in client-side code.
