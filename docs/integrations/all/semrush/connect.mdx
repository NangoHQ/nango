# Overview

To authenticate with Semrush (v3), you will need:
1. **API Key** - A key that grants Nango permission to interact with Semrush's v3 API resources and services.

This guide will walk you through finding your API Key within Semrush.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a registered Semrush account with a [Business tier SEO Toolkit subscription](https://developer.semrush.com/api/basics/how-to-get-api/) (API is available as an add-on).

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding Your API Key

1. Log in to your Semrush account and navigate to [API units](https://www.semrush.com/accounts/subscription-info/api-units/) page.
2. Locate your **API Key** on the Subscription Info page. If you don't see your **API Key** yet, you'll need to [purchase API units](https://developer.semrush.com/api/basics/how-to-get-api/) first.


#### Step 2: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have the **API Key**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Semrush (v3).
2. Enter your **API Key** in its designated field.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
