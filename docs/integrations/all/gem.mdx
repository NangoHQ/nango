## API gotchas

- Gem uses API_KEY auth mode with `x-api-key: API_KEY` and `x-application-secret: Application Secret` in the request header to access different endpoints.
- By default, each API key is subject to a rate limit of 20 requests per second, for more on this check [Rate Limits](https://api.gem.com/v0/reference#section/Rate-Limits) section.
