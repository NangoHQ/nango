  <Tab title="ðŸš€ Quickstart">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Instantly_.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Instantly">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then enter your Instantly credentials. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Instantly API">
        Let's make your first request to the Instantly API (fetch a list of campaigns). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl -X GET "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/v2/campaigns" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>" \
                  -H "Accept: application/json"
                ```
            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            const res = await nango.get({
              endpoint: '/v2/campaigns',
              providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
              connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
            });

            console.log(JSON.stringify(res.data, 2, null));
            ```
            </Tab>

        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

      </Step>
    </Steps>

    âœ… You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.

    <Tip>
    Next step: [Embed the auth flow](/getting-started/quickstart/embed-in-your-app) in your app to let your users connect their Instantly accounts.

  <Tab title="ðŸš¨ API gotchas">
      - The Hypergrowth plan is required for full API access. Free accounts start with 100 API tokens for testing.
      - Instantly has two API versions:
        - **v2 (current)** - Recommended for new integrations. Uses Bearer token authentication, supports multiple API keys with granular scopes, follows REST API standards, and has no compatibility with v1.
        - **v1 (deprecated 2025)** - Maintained for a while but not recommended for new integrations.
      - Rate limit: 10 requests per second for both API versions.
      - Multiple API keys can be created with different scopes for enhanced security.
