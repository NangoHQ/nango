#### Step 2: Create a New API Key

1. Click the **+ Create New API Key** button.
2. In the Create New API Key modal, fill in the required information:
   - **Name**: Enter a clear, recognizable name for your API key (e.g., "Nango Integration")
   - **Permissions**: Select the appropriate access level:
     - **Read Only**: Allows API access to view data but not modify it
     - **Read & Write**: Grants API access to both read and modify data (recommended for full integration)

3. Click **Add API Key** to create your API key.
4. **Important**: Copy your API key immediately and store it securely. The key should be treated as a password.

#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **API Key**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with TimeZest.
2. Enter your **API Key** in the provided field.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.

You are now connected to TimeZest.

### Additional Notes

- TimeZest recommends generating a separate API key for each integration to limit exposure if credentials are compromised
- API keys can be revoked immediately by deleting them from the API Keys settings page
- Authentication is done using Bearer token format: `Authorization: Bearer <API Key>`
