  <Tab title="🚀 Quickstart">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Google Cloud Storage_. Nango doesn't provide a test OAuth app for Google Cloud Storage yet. You’ll need to set up your own by following these [instructions](#🧑%E2%80%8D💻-oauth-app-setup). After that, make sure to add the OAuth client ID, secret, and scopes in the integration settings in Nango.

      <Note>
        Nango has credentials you can use for testing. Activate them in the dashboard.
      </Note>

      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Google Cloud Storage">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Google Cloud. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Google Cloud Storage API">
        Let's make your first request to the Google Cloud Storage API (fetch a list of project buckets). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/storage/v1/b?project={projectId}&maxResults=10" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
                ```

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            const res = await nango.get({
                endpoint: '/storage/v1/b',
                params: { maxResults: 10, project: {projectId} },
                providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
                connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
            });

            console.log(res.data);
            ```
            </Tab>


        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

      <Note>
        The `{projectId}` in the URL represents the `ID` of a valid project to retrieve a list of buckets from.
      </Note>
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.

    <Tip>
    Next step: [Embed the auth flow](/getting-started/quickstart/embed-in-your-app) in your app to let your users connect their Google Cloud Storage accounts.

    <Info>
      You will need to pass a security review to go live with your integration.

      [Follow our guide](/integrations/google-security-review) to get approved as fast as possible.
    </Info>

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a Google Cloud account">
        If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create a new project">
        1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
        2. Click on the project dropdown at the top left of the page.
        3. Click **New Project**.
        4. Enter a **Project Name** for your project.
        5. Under **Location**, select the appropriate organization or folder where this project should belong.
