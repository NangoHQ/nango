# Overview

To authenticate with Rippling, you need:
1. **API Token** - A key that grants secure access to the API, enabling authorized applications to interact with Rippling resources and services.

This guide will walk you through generating your API Token within Rippling.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an account with Rippling.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Generating Your API Token
1. Log in to your [Rippling](https://app.rippling.com/sign-in/id?next=%2Flogin&disablePartnerAccount=undefined) account.
2. Navigate to the API Tokens app by searching for it, finding it under ⚙️ Settings, or using the [direct link](https://app.rippling.com/api-tokens/).
3. Create a new API Token by providing a **name**, **unique identifier**, and selecting the **API version**. 
4. Configure the API permissions based on the required access, which is determined by the current user’s permissions. 
5. Copy and securely save the **API Token**, as it will only be displayed once.
<Note> Once the API Token is generated, a security notification will be sent to the owner, API Token app administrators, and super/full administrators.</Note>

#### Step 2: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **API Token**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Rippling.
