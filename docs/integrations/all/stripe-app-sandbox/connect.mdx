# Overview

To authenticate with Stripe App Sandbox, you need:
1. **App Domain** - A temporary id used to identify your application.

This guide will walk you through finding your **App Domain** within Stripe.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have created and uploaded a Stripe App.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding Your App Domain

After creating your Stripe app and setting up OAuth:
1. Go to your app's **External test** tab in the Stripe Dashboard.
2. Under **Test OAuth**, find the **Live mode link** or **Test mode link** (e.g., https://marketplace.stripe.com/oauth/v2/ch_1234abcd?client_id=ca_1234XYZ&...)
3. Your App Domain is the value immediately after `/v2/` — in this case, it’s:
```
ch_1234abcd
```
This is the unique identifier Stripe assigns to your app instance.

#### Step 2: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have the **App Domain**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Stripe App Sandbox.
2. Enter your **App Domain** in the designated field.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
