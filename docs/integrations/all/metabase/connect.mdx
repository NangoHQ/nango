# Overview

To authenticate with Metabase, you need the following:
1. **API Key** - A unique key that provides access to your Metabase account.
2. **Metabase Domain** - The domain (without the extension) of your Metabase account.

This guide will walk you through generating your API Key and finding your Metabase domain.

---

## Prerequisites
- You must have administrative access to your Metabase account.
- Ensure you have permission to generate and manage API keys.

---

## Step 1: Generating an API Key
1. Log in to your **Metabase** account.
2. Click on the **gear icon** in the top-right corner of the interface and select **Admin settings**.
3. Navigate to the **Settings** tab, and click on the **Authentication** option in the left menu.
4. Scroll to the **API Keys** section and click **Manage**.
5. Click on the **Create API Key** button.
6. In the **Key Name** field, provide a name for your key that reflects its purpose.
7. Assign the key to a **Group**. The permissions for the API key will be the same as those granted to the selected group.
8. Click **Create**.
9. **Copy the generated API Key** and store it securely. Metabase will not show the key again.

## Step 2: Finding Your Metabase Domain
Your Metabase domain is the subdomain of your account's URL. For example, if your Metabase account is hosted at:

https://your-metabase-instance.com

Your domain is **`your-metabase-instance`**.

---

## Step 3: Connecting Your Metabase Account
To link your Metabase account:
1. Navigate to the Metabase authentication form in your application.
2. Enter the following details:
   - **API Key**: Paste the key you generated in Step 1.
   - **Metabase Domain**: Enter your Metabase domain (without the `.com` or `.org` extension) from Step 2.
3. Click **Connect** to complete the authentication process.

### Notes
- **API Key**: Keep your API Key secure, as it grants access to your Metabase account.
- **Domain**: Double-check your domain for accuracy to avoid connection issues.
