## Setup guide

### Step 1: Create an API Key

To create an API key for Hightouch:

1. Log in to your Hightouch workspace
2. Navigate to the API keys tab in Settings
3. Select "Add API key"
4. Enter a descriptive name for your API key
5. Copy the generated API key (displayed only once)
6. Store the API key securely

<Warning>The API key is only displayed once during creation. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new one.</Warning>
