## API gotchas

-   When creating an integration on the UI, please use **_squareup-sandbox_** for development and **_squareup_** for production.
-   Please! It is important you follow this instruction [here](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/oauth-api/walkthrough) to create an app and an account that can be used for testing.
-   When testing in the sandbox environment, you must first launch the seller test account from the Developer Console. For detailed instructions, please [visit squareup guide](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/oauth-api/walkthrough#3-set-up-a-seller-test-account-and-simulate-the-seller-authorization).
