# Overview

To authenticate with Tableau, you need:
1. **Personal Access Token** - This is the name/label you assigned to the Personal Access Token when you created it in Tableau.
2. **Personal Access Token Secret** - This is the secret/token string that was generated along with the token name acting like a password. 
3. **HostName** - This is your Tableau **server domain or host URL** (not including protocol).
4. **API Version** - This is the version of the **Tableau REST API** you want to connect to which must match the version supported by your Tableau environment.
5. **Content Url (Optional)** - This identifies the site within your Tableau instance that you want to sign in to.

This guide will walk you through obtaining the above credentials within Tableau.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an active Tableau instance.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Enabling Personal Access Token
- If this is enabled, you can skip to [step 2](#step-2%3A-generating-your-personal-access-token) below.
1. Log in to your Tableau instance and naviagate to **Settings** > **General**.
2. Scroll down to **Personal Access Tokens** section.

3. Ensure the **Enable personal access tokens** checkbox is selected. You can choose to either allow all users to create PATs or limit access to a specified group.
4. If restricting access to a group, select the **Only users in the specified group** radio button and choose the relevant group from the list. Note that a group must be selected to save this setting.
5. Under **Set expiration period**, opt for either the **180 days** radio button or enter a custom value (1 through 365) in the **Custom days** text box.
6. Once configured, click the **Save** button at the top or bottom of the page to apply the changes.

#### Step 2: Generating your Personal Access Token
1. Once you've confirmed that **Personal Access Tokens** are enabled, click on your profile icon at the top right, then select **My Account Settings**.
2. Navigate to the **Settings** tab, then scroll down to **Personal Access Tokens** section.
3. Enter a name for your **Personal Access Token**, this will serve as your token's identifier, then click **Create Token**.

4. A secret will be generated, this is your **Personal Access Token Secret**. Make sure to copy and store it securely, as it will not be shown again.

#### Step 3: Finding your HostName
- Look at your browser’s address bar. Your **Hostname** is everything that appears after `https://` and before `/#/`. For example, if your URL is: `https://dub01.online.tableau.com/#/site/test-eaec4a3fe2/user/external/dummy@nango.dev.com/settings`, your **HostName** is `dub01.online.tableau.com`.

#### Step 4: Finding your API Version
- This is the **REST API version** you want to connect to. You can find the full list of supported versions [here](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_concepts_versions.htm).


#### Step 5: Finding your Content Url
- Look at your browser’s address bar. Your **Content URL** is the value that appears immediately after `/site/` and before the next `/`. For example, if your URL is:`https://dub01.online.tableau.com/#/site/test-eaec4a3fe2/user/external/dummy@nango.dev.com/settings`, your **Content Url** is `test-eaec4a3fe2`.

<Note>For **Tableau Server**, you can leave this field blank to use the default site. For **Tableau Cloud**, a valid **Content URL** is required.</Note>

#### Step 6: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your credential:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Tableau.
2. Enter your credentials in their respective fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
