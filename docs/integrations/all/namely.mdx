## Setup guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Namely API section">
    Log in to your Namely site.  
    Click the _Admin_ dropdown and select _API_.
    If you don't see the **API** menu, contact your Namely administrator or client success manager to obtain the necessary permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an OAuth application">
    In the _API_ section, navigate to the _OAuth Applications_ tab.  
    Click to create a new OAuth application and fill out the following fields:
    
    - **Name**: Enter a human-readable name for your OAuth app (e.g. `Nango Integration`).
    - **Website**: Enter your company's website (e.g. `https://example.com`).
    - **Redirect URI(s)**: Specify one or more redirect URIs. Use a comma-separated list if you have multiple.  
      
    For Nango, configure the following Redirect URL: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.

    After creating the app, copy/paste the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`; you will need them when configuring Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to set up your Namely integration in Nango.
  </Step>
</Steps>
