# Configuring ConnectWise PSA Webhooks

To receive webhooks from ConnectWise PSA, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your Nango webhook URL">
    1. Go to the Nango UI and navigate to the _Integrations_ tab
    2. Select your ConnectWise PSA integration
    3. Go to the _Settings_ sub-tab
    4. Copy your unique webhook URL (it should look like `https://api.nango.dev/webhook/<UUID>/connectwise-psa`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your trusted ConnectWise subdomain in Nango">
    1. In the Nango UI _Settings_ page for your ConnectWise PSA integration
    2. In the **Webhook Configuration** section, enter your ConnectWise subdomain in the **Webhook Secret** field
    3. The subdomain should be just the subdomain portion (
       e.g., `mycompany` if you log into Connectwise at `mycompany.myconnectwise.net`)
    4. Click **Save**

    <Warning>
      This subdomain is used for security validation. Only webhooks from this specific ConnectWise subdomain will be accepted.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a webhook callback in ConnectWise">
    ConnectWise callbacks are created via the REST API. You can use curl, Postman, or any HTTP client:

    **Example curl command**:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
      https://{subdomain}.myconnectwise.net/v4_6_release/apis/3.0/system/callbacks \
      -u "{username}:{password}" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "clientId: {clientId}" \
      -d '{
        "description": "Nango webhook for tickets",
        "url": "https://api.nango.dev/webhook/<YOUR-UUID>/connectwise-psa",
        "objectId": 1,
        "type": "ticket",
        "level": "owner"
      }'
    ```

    **Configuration Parameters**:
    - **subdomain**: Your ConnectWise subdomain - see step 2
    - **username**: Your ConnectWise username (CompanyId + Public Key/Integrator Username/MemberId)
    - **password**: Your ConnectWise password (Private Key/Integrator Password/Member Hash)
    - **clientId**: Your integration's Client ID from ConnectWise

    These are the same credentials you use when [connecting to ConnectWise PSA in Nango](/integrations/all/connectwise-psa).

    **Callback Options**:
    - **url**: Your Nango webhook URL from step 1
    - **description**: A label for this callback
    - **type**: Object type - `ticket`, `company`, `contact`, `project`, etc.
    - **level**: Trigger level - `owner`, `board`, `status`, or `all`
    - **objectId**: Specific board/object ID (use `1` for all boards)

    For detailed API documentation, refer to the [ConnectWise Developer Portal](https://developer.connectwise.com/)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the webhook">
    1. Trigger an event in ConnectWise that matches your callback configuration (e.g., create a new ticket)
    2. Check your Nango logs to verify that the webhook was received and processed
    3. Your webhooks are now ready to receive events from ConnectWise PSA
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Security

ConnectWise PSA webhooks are secured using HMAC-SHA256 signatures. Nango automatically:
1. Fetches the signing key from ConnectWise using the URL provided in the webhook payload
2. Validates that the signing key URL is from your configured trusted subdomain
3. Verifies the webhook signature using the fetched key
4. Only processes webhooks that pass signature validation

This ensures that only legitimate webhooks from your ConnectWise environment are accepted.

## Webhook Events

Once configured, you can receive webhook events from ConnectWise PSA for various object types, including...
- **Service Tickets**: Created, updated, or deleted tickets
- **Companies**: Created or updated company records
- **Contacts**: Created or updated contact records
- **Projects**: Created, updated, or deleted projects
- **Time Entries**: Created or updated time entries
- **Expenses**: Created or updated expense entries

For more details on available callback types, refer to the [ConnectWise PSA API documentation](https://developer.connectwise.com/Products/ConnectWise_PSA/Developer_Guide#Callbacks_(Webhooks)).
