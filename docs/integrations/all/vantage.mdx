## Setup guide

<Tip>Need help getting started? Get help in the [community](https://nango.dev/slack).</Tip>

#### Step 1: Generating an API token {#step-1-generating-an-api-token}
1. Sign in to your [Vantage](https://www.vantage.sh/) workspace.
2. Open **Settings → API** and create a new API token (the token begins with `vtkn_`).
3. Copy the token immediately; it is shown once and will be used as the **API Token** credential in Nango.

#### Step 2: Connect the integration
1. In the Nango dashboard, create a new integration using the **Vantage** provider.
2. Enter the API token from Step 1 when prompted.
3. Save the integration and create a connection to verify the credentials.

## API usage
- Base URL: `https://api.vantage.sh/v2`.
- Authentication: send `Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN` in request headers.
- Retrieve daily service costs with `GET /costs?groupings=service&date_bin=day&limit=1000`. Add `cost_report_token=rprt_...` to have the API apply an existing report’s filters.
- Responses include a `links.next` URL for pagination; continue requesting until `next` is absent.
- Cost rows include `accrued_at`, `service`, `amount`, `currency`, and other dimensions defined in the report.
- Dates are UTC. When you need a PST window ending “yesterday,” convert `23:59:59` PST to UTC before sending it as `end_date`.
- API tokens must have permission to read Cost Reports; share tokens from a report with the desired scope.

## API gotchas

- When filtering by a saved report, pass `cost_report_token=...`; using `report_id` results in `400` errors.
- The `limit` parameter accepts values up to `1000`—use it to reduce pagination.
- Retry `429` responses after the `x-rate-limit-reset` timestamp; 4xx errors other than `429` should not be retried.
