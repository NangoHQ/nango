6. Click **GENERATE KEY** to create your API key.
7. **Important**: Copy your API key immediately. You can only create a maximum of 5 keys at a time, and each key should be treated as securely as a password.

Once you have your **API Key**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with DNSFilter.
2. Enter your **API Key** in the provided field.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
