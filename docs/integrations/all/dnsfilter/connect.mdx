2. In the Create API Key modal, fill in the required information:

3. Click **GENERATE KEY** to create your API key.

Once you have your **API Key**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with DNSFilter.
2. Enter your **API Key** in the provided field.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
