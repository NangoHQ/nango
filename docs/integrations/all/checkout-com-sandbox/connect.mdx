# Overview

To authenticate with Checkout, you will need:
1. **Client ID** - A unique identifier for your application on Checkout.
2. **Client Secret** - A key that grants full access to all your application and configurations.

This guide will walk you through generating the Client ID and Client Secret within Checkout.


## Prerequisites:
- You should have a registered test account with Checkout. Create one on [Checkout Getting Started page](https://checkout.com/).
- Permission to generate **API Keys**.

#### Step 1: Creating an Access Key Pair (Client ID and Client Secret)

1. From your Checkout sandbox dashboard, click on the **Developer** icon at the top right corner of the screen.

**Note:** It is important to store the key pair securely as it will not be visible again once you leave the Key page.


#### Step 2: Connect Your Checkout.com Account

To authenticate using your client credentials, navigate to the Checkout authentication form.

Enter your credentials as follows:
- Client ID: Your client ID
- Client Secret: Your client secret
Click "Connect" to complete the authentication.

Note: Make sure to match the credentials exactly as shown above - the field names in the form may differ from your Checkout dashboard.
