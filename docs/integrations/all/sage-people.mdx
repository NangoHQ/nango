## API gotchas

- **Salesforce Authentication**: Sage People uses Salesforce authentication, so you must set up a Salesforce OAuth app first.
- **Sage People API User**: After setting up the Salesforce Connected App, you need to [create a new API user](/integrations/all/sage-people/connect#step-1-create-a-sage-people-api-user) within Sage People with the necessary permission sets where we have the **Sage People API** package installed. This user will be used to authenticate with the Connected App you created above.
