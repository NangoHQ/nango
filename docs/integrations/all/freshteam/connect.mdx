# Overview

To authenticate with Freshteam, you need two key pieces of information:
1. **Account Name** - This is a unique name assigned to your Freshteam account.
2. **API key** - A key that grants Nango permission to interact with Freshteam's APIs resources and services.

This guide will walk you through obtaining both the Account Name and API key within Freshteam.

### Prerequisites:

- You must be an existing customer, as Freshteam is not available for new customers.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding Your Account Name
1. When logged into Freshteam, look at the browser's address bar. The text before `.freshteam.com` is your **Account Name**.

#### Step 2: Finding Your API Key
1. **Log in** to your Freshteam account.
2. Go to your **Profile** avatar inside Freshteam and click on it. 
3. In the drop-down that appears, you will find **API Key**.
