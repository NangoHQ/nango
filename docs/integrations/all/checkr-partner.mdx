## API gotchas

-  As a partner you are provided with both staging and a production account. For more details check [staging vs production accounts](https://docs.checkr.com/partners/#section/Getting-Started/Staging-vs-Production-accounts)
-  The `access_token` generated are long lived, until revoked and don't need to be refreshed.
-  Checkr requires partners to comply with a quick integration review so as to make the integration production ready. For more details check [production approval process](https://docs.checkr.com/partners/#section/Production-Approval-Process)
-  After creating a connection, Checkr requires you to pass the `access_token` as Basic Authentication as follows:
```js
        const connection = await nango.getConnection();
        let access_token: string;
        if ('access_token' in connection.credentials) {
            access_token = connection.credentials.access_token;
        } else {
            throw new nango.ActionError({
                message: `access_token is missing`
            });
        }
        const config = {
            endpoint: '/v1/account',
            headers: {
                Authorization: 'Basic ' + Buffer.from(access_token + ':').toString('base64')
            }
        }

        const response = await nango.get(config);
```
