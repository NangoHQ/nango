# Overview

Medallia Experience Cloud APIs use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate access to data and API endpoints. To establish a connection with Medallia, you will need the following:

1. **Domain** - The base domain for your Medallia instance
2. **Tenant Name** - The tenant name of your Medallia account.
3. **API Host URL** - The base API endpoint (gateway URL) for your Medallia account.
4. **Client ID** - A unique identifier for your client.
5. **Client Secret** - A confidential key used to authenticate the identity of the application (client).

This guide will walk you through generating and finding these credentials within Medallia.

### Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Medallia Experience Cloud instance.

### Step 1: Generating OAuth Credentials

To obtain your Client ID and Client Secret:

1. Log into your Medallia Experience Cloud instance.
2. Navigate to **Integrations** → **OAuth**.
3. Find the client you want to use (or create a new one if you don't have one) and copy your **Client ID**.
4. If you don't have a client secret for the selected client, generate a new client secret and copy it securely.
5. Navigate to **Company** → **Users**.
6. Go to the **User Edit Roles** tab and ensure the client has sufficient permissions to access the data and actions you need.

<Note> Each environment (production, sandbox, developer) requires separate credentials. </Note>

### Step 2: Identifying Your Domain

1. Look at the URL you use to access Medallia Web reporting.
2. The URL format is: `https://<instance>.<domain>.<tld>/<company>`
3. Your **Domain** is the `<instance>.<domain>.<tld>` portion.
4. Example: If your URL is `https://instance.medallia.com/acme`, your Domain is `instance.medallia.com`

### Step 3: Identifying Your Tenant Name

1. Your **Tenant Name** is the `<company>` portion in your Medallia Web reporting URL.
2. Using the URL format: `https://<instance>.<domain>.<tld>/<company>`
3. Example: If your URL is `https://instance.medallia.com/acme`, your Tenant Name is `acme`

### Step 4: Identifying Your API Host URL

The **API Host URL** varies based on your environment:

1. **Production**: `https://<instance>-<company>.apis.medallia.<tld>`
   - Example: `https://fo-acme.apis.medallia.eu`

2. **Sandbox**: `https://<sandbox-name>-<company>.apis.sbx.<data-center>.medallia.<tld>`
   - Example: `https://dev-acme.apis.sbx.usw1.medallia.com`

3. **GovCloud Production**: `https://<instance>-<company>.apis.medalliafederal.<tld>`
   - Example: `https://fo-acme.apis.medalliafederal.com`

4. **GovCloud Sandbox**: `https://<sandbox-name>-<company>.apis.sbx.fedw1.medalliafederal.com`
   - Example: `https://dev-acme.apis.sbx.fedw1.medalliafederal.com`

<Note> Host URLs with the form `https://<company>.apis.medallia.<tld>` are deprecated and only valid for legacy clients. </Note>

### Step 5: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your credentials:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Medallia.
2. Enter your **Domain**, **Tenant Name**, **API Host URL**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** in their designated fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
