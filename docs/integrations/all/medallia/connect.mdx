# Overview

Medallia Experience Cloud APIs use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate access to data and API endpoints. To establish a connection with Medallia, you will need the following:

1. **Client ID**: The unique identifier for your account, used as the HTTP Basic Authentication username.
2. **Client Secret**: The secret key for your account, used as the HTTP Basic Authentication password.
3. **Reporting Instance**: The domain of your Medallia account.
4. **Tenant Name**: The tenant name of your Medallia account.
5. **Gateway URL**: The gateway URL for your Medallia account.

This guide will walk you through generating these credentials and using them to connect your account.

### Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Medallia Experience Cloud instance.
- OAuth 2.0 enabled for your account.

---

### Step 1: Generate OAuth Credentials

To access Medallia APIs, you need to create a Client ID and Client Secret:

1. **Log into your Medallia Experience Cloud instance**:
   - Navigate to the **Admin Settings**.
   - Go to the **OAuth 2.0 Management** section.

2. **Create a new Client ID and Client Secret**:
   - Click **Create OAuth Client**.
   - Assign a role to the client ID. This role determines the actions and data the client ID can access.
   - Save the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret** securely. These values will not be shown again.

⚠️ **Note**: Each environment (production, sandbox, developer) requires separate credentials.

---

### Step 2: Retrieve an Access Token

1. **Identify the OAuth Token URL**:
   - Use the following format:
     `https://${reportingInstance}/oauth/${tenantName}/token`.

2. **Request a Token**:
   - Use the Client ID and Client Secret to send a `POST` request to the OAuth endpoint.
   - Example `cURL` command:

     ```bash
     export REPORTING_INSTANCE="instance.medallia.com"
     export TENANT_NAME="tenant"

     curl \
       "https://${REPORTING_INSTANCE}/oauth/${TENANT_NAME}/token" \
       -X POST \
       -u 'client_id:client_secret' \
       -d 'grant_type=client_credentials'
     ```

3. **Access Token Response**:
   - If successful, you will receive a response like this:

     ```json
     {
       "access_token": "2c5822312345678901d21",
       "token_type": "Bearer",
       "expires_in": 3600
     }
     ```

   - Save the `access_token` securely. Use it in subsequent API requests.

### Step 3: Connect Your Medallia Account

1. **Field Requirements**:
   - **Reporting Instance**: Enter the domain of your Medallia account (e.g., `instance.medallia.com`).
   - **Tenant Name**: Provide the tenant name for your account.
   - **Gateway URL**: Specify the gateway URL (e.g., `instance-tenant.apis.medallia.com`).
   - **Client ID and Secret**: Use the credentials generated earlier.

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - The integration will use your Client ID and Secret to fetch an access token.
   - The token will authenticate your connection to the Medallia API.

---

### Notes

- Tokens expire after 3600 seconds (1 hour). The integration will refresh tokens automatically as needed.
- Ensure that the role assigned to your Client ID has the necessary permissions for your use case.
- For API usage and permissions, refer to the [Medallia Experience Cloud documentation](https://developer.medallia.com/medallia-apis/reference/integrations).
