    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Teamleader Focus_. Nango doesn't provide a test OAuth app for Teamleader Focus yet. You’ll need to set up your own by following these [instructions](#🧑%E2%80%8D💻-oauth-app-setup). After that, make sure to add the OAuth client ID and secret in the integration settings in Nango.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Teamleader Focus">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Teamleader Focus. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Teamleader Focus API">
        Let's make your first request to the Teamleader Focus API (fetch a list of deals). This request will return basic details about the authenticated user. Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl -X POST "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/deals.list" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>" \
                  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                  -d '{
                    "page": {
                      "size": 10
                    }
                  }'
                ```

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

            const res = await nango.post({
                endpoint: '/deals.list',
                data: {
                  "page": {
                    "size": 10
                  }
                },
                providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
                connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
            });

             console.log(JSON.stringify(res.data, null, 2));
            ```
            </Tab>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).
