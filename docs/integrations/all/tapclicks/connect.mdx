# Overview

To authenticate with TapClicks, you need two key pieces of information:
1. **Client ID** - A unique identifier for your client.
2. **Client Secret** - A confidential key used to authenticate the identity of the application (client).

This guide will walk you through obtaining these credentials within TapClicks.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an account with TapClicks.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Requesting API credentials
1. Access the [OAuth2 Client Credentials section](https://apidocs.tapclicks.com/v2/6.27/index.html#section/AUTHENTICATION/oAuth2ClientCredentials), where you'll find a link to the form. Follow the link to complete the form.

-   Once this is done, an email containing the Client ID and Client Secret will be sent within 24-48 hrs, to the email address of the TapClicks super admin user who requested access.
