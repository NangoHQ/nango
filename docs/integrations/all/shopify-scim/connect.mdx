# Overview

To authenticate with Shopify SCIM, you need one key piece of information:
1. **SCIM API Token** - A token generated from your Shopify organization settings to authenticate SCIM requests.

This guide will walk you through the steps to generate and use this token to connect your Shopify account.

---

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an **Enterprise** Shopify Plus account.
- You must have a verified domain and a configured **SAML Authentication** for your organization.
- The logged-in user **must** have the necessary admin privileges to generate the SCIM API token.

---

## Step 1: Generating Your SCIM API Token

1. Log in to your Shopify admin and navigate to **Settings > Users**.
2. Select the **Security** tab.
3. In the **SCIM Integration** section, click **Generate API Token**.
4. Click **Copy** to copy the generated API token to your clipboard.

**Important**: Store your API token securely, as it will be required to connect your Shopify account.

## Step 2: Base URL for SCIM API Integration

When connecting your identity provider, you may need to provide a **Base URL** for Shopify SCIM. Use the following:
https://shopifyscim.com/scim/


This URL is required by most identity providers to integrate with Shopify's SCIM API.

## Step 3: Connect Your Shopify Account

To authenticate with Shopify SCIM:

1. Navigate to the Shopify authentication form in your identity service provider.
2. Enter the following credentials:
   - **API Token**: Paste the token generated in Step 1.
   - **Base URL**: Use `https://shopifyscim.com/scim/`.

3. Test the connection to verify the credentials.
4. Click **Connect** to complete the authentication process.

## Additional Notes

- Once connected, you can use SCIM to:
  - Create and update users.
  - Assign or update user roles.
  - Deactivate users.
- Make sure the users are associated with a verified domain for your organization.
- For detailed SCIM integration steps with identity providers like Okta, OneLogin, or Entra, refer to the [Shopify Help Center](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/organization-settings/users/security/scim).

**Keep your SCIM API token confidential and do not share it publicly. If the token is compromised, generate a new one immediately.**
