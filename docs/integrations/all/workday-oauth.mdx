    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Workday (OAuth)_.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Authorize Workday">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Workday. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Workday API">
        Let's make your first request to the Workday API (fetch worker information). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/v1/{connectionConfig.tenant}/workers" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
                ```

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:


            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });
            const connectionId = '<CONNECTION-ID>';
            const providerConfigKey = '<INTEGRATION-ID>';
            const connection = await nango.getConnection(providerConfigKey, connectionId);

            const res = await nango.get({
                endpoint: `/v1/${connection.connection_config['tenant']}/workers`,
                providerConfigKey,
                connectionId
            });

            console.log(JSON.stringify(res.data, null, 2));
            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

        <Note>
        The `{connectionConfig.tenant}` in the URL represents the `tenant`. You can get this value from your connection configuration after creating the connection.
        </Note>
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ‚úÖ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.

  <Tab title="üßë‚Äçüíª OAuth app setup">
   <Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Workday API Client Registration">
    1. Log in to your **Workday tenant** as an administrator.
    2. In the **Search bar**, type **Register API Client** and select it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create OAuth 2.0 credentials">
      1. On the **Register API Client** page, configure:
        - **Client Name**: Enter a unique, descriptive name (e.g., `Nango HRIS Integration`).
        - **Client Grant Type**: Select **Authorization Code Grant** (required for OAuth 2.0 flows).
        - **Access Token Type**: Select **Bearer** (standard for API authentication).
        - **Redirection URI**: Set to `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
        - **Non-Expiring Refresh Tokens**: ‚úÖ Enable (recommended for long-lived access).
        - **Scope** (Functional Areas):
          + **Custom Objects > System** (required for custom object operations).
          + **System - Workday Query Language (WQL)** (required for WQL queries).
          + **HRIS** (for core employee/personnel data).
          + **Staffing** (for recruitment/hiring data).
          + **Tenant Non-Configurable** (read-only tenant settings).
        - **Include Workday Owned Scope**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional, It grants access to API scopes that are owned and managed by Workday itself.
    2. Click **OK** to generate client credentials (**Client ID and Client Secret**), save these credentials securely as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.

    - Workday provides two APIs, a REST and a SOAP one and Nango supports them both.
    - Access to most Workday's API doc resources, including detailed documentation on OAuth authentication flows, is typically restricted to Workday customers and partners. To access these resources, you can:‚Äã
    1. **Sign In to Workday Community**: Visit the [Workday Community](https://community.workday.com/) and sign in with your Workday credentials. If you don't have an account, you can [request one](https://workday.my.site.com/customercenter/register).
    2. **Contact Workday Support**: If you are a customer, reach out to Workday Support for assistance in accessing specific documentation.
