## API gotchas

- You need to configure an External Identity Provider in IAM Identity Center and set up SAML to be able to use SCIM
- AWS (SCIM) uses `API_KEY` auth mode with `Authorization: Bearer ${apiKey}` in the request header to access different endpoints.
- To establish a new connection in Nango, you need to provide the `SCIM Endpoint` from the AWS Identity Center
