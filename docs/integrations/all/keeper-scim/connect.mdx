# Overview

To authenticate with Keeper, you need two key pieces of information:
1. **API Key** - A unique identifier for your application on Keeper.
2. *Keeper node Id** - Is a unique identifier for a node in the Keeper node architecture. Nodes are used to organize users into groups, such as by department, location, or division.

Note: You will need to create a new node under the root node.

This guide will walk you through finding or creating those credentials within Keeper.


### Prerequisites:

- You must set up an Enterprise account with Keeper.


#### Step 1: Finding Your node id
1. Log into your admin Keeper account and navigate to the **Admin** tab

2. The root node will be the same as the organization name. Click the Kebab menu and create a new child node with a name of your choice.
