# Overview

To authenticate with PostHog, you need one key piece of information:
1. **API Key** - Your PostHog Access Key

This guide will walk you through finding or creating those credentials within PostHog.

### Prerequisites:

- You must set up an account with PostHog.

#### Step 1: Finding Your PostHog API Key
1. Go to the [Personal API](https://us.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys) keys section in your account settings.

2. Click `+ Create a personal API Key`.

3. Give your key a label - this is just for you, usually to describe the key's purpose.

4. Choose the scopes for your key. We recommend selecting only the scopes required for the API endpoints you really need. This is a security best practice. You can always modify the scopes later if you need to.

5. At the top of the list, you should see your brand new key. Securely copy its value, as you'll never see it again after refreshing the page.

#### Step 2: Finding your PostHog domain

1. You must make API requests to the correct domain. 
On US Cloud, these are `https://us.i.posthog.com` for public endpoints and `https://us.posthog.com` for private ones.
On EU Cloud, these are `https://eu.i.posthog.com` for public endpoints and `https://eu.posthog.com` for private ones.
For self-hosted instances, use your self-hosted domain.
Confirm yours by checking your PostHog instance URL.

Click "Connect" to complete the authentication.
