# Overview

To authenticate with Klaviyo, you need one key piece of information:
1. **API Key** - Your Klaviyo private key.

This guide will walk you through finding or creating those credentials within Klaviyo.

### Prerequisites:

- You must set up an account with Klaviyo.

#### Step 1: Finding Your Klaviyo API Key
1. Log into your Klaviyo account and navigate to your account’s `Settings` page and select `API keys`.
2. Under the `Private API Keys` section, select `Create Private API Key`.
3. Provide a name for your private key and add any of the following scopes:
    - `Custom Key`: Allows you to decide how much access to give the third party.
    - `Read-Only Key`: Only allows third parties to view all data associated with the endpoint.
    - `Full Access Key`: Allows third parties to create, delete, or make changes to anything associated with that endpoint.

Important: For your account's security, your private API keys should never be used with Client endpoints, exposed in client-side code, or made accessible from public repositories.
