# Overview

To authenticate with Auvik, you need:
1. **Username** – Your Auvik account username (usually your email address).
2. **API Key** – Your Auvik API key (separate from your password).
3. **Region** – Your Auvik region (e.g., `us1`, `us2`, `eu1`). This determines your API base URL like `https://auvikapi.<region>.my.auvik.com`.

This guide walks you through generating an API key and finding your region in Auvik.

### Prerequisites:

- Optional: create a new, separate Auvik account within your organization to hold your API Key
  so that this key is not tied to any one individual. Auvik documentation refers to this as
  setting up a ["service account."](https://support.auvik.com/hc/en-us/articles/204309114-How-do-I-update-my-user-profile#topic_generate)
- Access to your Auvik account with API permissions.

### Step 1: Generate an API Key

1. Log in to your Auvik dashboard.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the left-hand nav. Look for your account's name and click to view and edit your profile.

4. Copy and securely store your **API Key** – this is separate from your password and will be used for API authentication.

5. Your **Username** is the email address associated with your Auvik account.

See: [Auvik API Documentation](https://auvikapi.us1.my.auvik.com/docs)

### Step 2: Determine your region

Your region is visible in your browser's address bar when you're logged into the Auvik web UI:

- If your URL is `https://yourcompany.us1.my.auvik.com/...` → Your region is `us1`
- If your URL is `https://yourcompany.us2.my.auvik.com/...` → Your region is `us2`
- If your URL is `https://yourcompany.eu1.my.auvik.com/...` → Your region is `eu1`

Common regions:
- `us1` → `https://auvikapi.us1.my.auvik.com`
- `us2` → `https://auvikapi.us2.my.auvik.com`
- `eu1` → `https://auvikapi.eu1.my.auvik.com`

### Step 3: Enter your details in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Username**, **API Key**, and **Region**:
1. Open the form where you connect to Auvik.
2. Enter your **Username** (email address).
3. Enter your **API Key**.
4. Enter your **Region** (e.g., `us2`).
5. Click **Connect**.
