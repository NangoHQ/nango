## API gotchas

- Auvik uses Basic authentication with username and API key. Your API key is _not_ the password associated with your username.
  Follow [Auvik's instructions](https://support.auvik.com/hc/en-us/articles/204309114-How-do-I-update-my-user-profile#topic_generate)
  to generate an API key for your account.
- When you generate an Auvik API key, it will only be visible once. Make sure you store it securely as soon as you generate it.
- Make sure to use the correct regional API endpoint (us1, us2, eu1, etc.) based on your account region. You can find your Region
  by logging into your Auvik account on the web and checking the address bar. You should seem something like
  https://yourtenantname.us2.my.auvik.com/#msp/root/clients. In this case, your region would be `us2`.
