Nango is the leading provider of **API access for AI agents & products**. It is designed for developers building integrations for their users, with full flexibility.

## Integration primitives

Nango provides a set of powerful primitives that you can combine to build any integration:

- **[Auth](/guides/primitives/auth)**: Managed API authorization for 500+ APIs
- **[Proxy](/guides/primitives/proxy)**: Query APIs via Nango with credentials injection
- **[Functions](/guides/primitives/functions)**: Build custom integrations in code with a scalable runtime

## Flexible use cases

Flexible by design, Nango never constrains the integrations you need to build:
- **[Tool calling](/implementation-guides/use-cases/tool-calling/overview)**
- **[MCPs](/implementation-guides/use-cases/tool-calling/implement-mcp-server)**
- **[Data syncing & RAG](/implementation-guides/use-cases/syncs/implement-a-sync)**
- **[Triggers](/implementation-guides/use-cases/syncs/implement-a-sync)**
- **[Real-time webhooks](/implementation-guides/use-cases/webhooks-from-external-apis)**
- **[Per customer configs](/implementation-guides/use-cases/customer-configuration)**
- **[Unified APIs](/implementation-guides/use-cases/unified-apis)** 
- **[More](/implementation-guides/use-cases)**

## Approach & Benefits

We believe teams should build their own integrations, but with better primitives.

By leveraging Nango, developers can save weeks per integration:
- **Fast**: Avoid rebuilding hard infrastructure & per-API tools.
- **Flexible**: code-based integrations with full access to external APIs.
- **Dev-centric**: API-first & infrastructure as code for mature development workflows.
- **Reliable**: Production-ready primitives from day one.
- **Secure**: Secure handling of credentials and user data.
- **Observable**: Full visibility into every API interaction.
- **Modular**: Use only what you need, without vendor lock-in.
- **Proven at scale**: Powers millions of users for companies like Replit, Linux, etc.
