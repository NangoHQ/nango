Nango is the platform to **authorize and access APIs** on behalf of your customers.

## Who is Nango for?

Nango is designed for developers building **product integrations**: Letting users connect their external accounts to your own product.

## Core features

- **[API Auth](/guides/use-cases/api-auth)** for [500+ APIs](/integrations/overview)
    - **Embedded, white-label auth UI**: With appropriate input forms and guidance.
    - **Secure credential management**: Retrieval, storage, and refreshing of API credentials.
    - **Credential monitoring**: Notifies via webhooks when credentials become invalid.
- **[Request proxying](/guides/use-cases/proxy)**: Injects credentials into API requests seamlessly.
- **[Data Syncing](/guides/use-cases/syncs)**: Continuously synchronize data from APIs to your application.
- **[Actions](/guides/use-cases/actions)**: Encapsulate use cases into reusable actions.
- **[Webhooks](/guides/use-cases/webhooks)**: Listen to webhooks from APIs with a universal interface.
- **[AI tool calling & MCP server](/guides/use-cases/ai-tool-calling)**: Expose your integrations as tools to any LLM or AI agent.
- **[Observability](/guides/platform/logs)**: Tailored monitoring for integrations.
- **Management dashboard & APIs**: Control and oversee all connected accounts.

## Benefits

- **Speed**: Eliminates the need to build authorization flows and infrastructure for each API.
- **Reliability**: Provides a robust solution from day one.
- **Security**: Ensures secure storage and retrieval of API credentials & user data.
- **Observability**: Provides full visibility into every interaction with the external API.
- **Modularity**: Pick the features you want to use, without vendor lock-in.

By leveraging Nango, developers can save days per integration and months over time.

## Our approach to integrations

We believe engineering teams should build their own integrations.

### The case for building integrations

Every product has unique data structures and user workflows. When you build an integration, you map your product and the external product together. This requires a deep understanding of _both_ products.

When you buy pre-built integrations you are forced into someone else's assumptions about how your data should connect. This often doesn't match your users' expectations or your product's logic.

### The control and reliability advantage

When you build integrations in-house, you maintain full control over API requests, data transformations, and debugging capabilities.

With pre-built solutions, you're dependent on external support teams to fix issues and prioritize your requests, which can lead to delays and frustration when problems arise in production.

### A better way to build

Our goal with Nango is to provide a better way to build integrations:
- Nango provides the infrastructure to build reliable, scalable integrations fast: API auth, syncing framework, webhook handling, observability, etc.
- You focus on what makes your integration great for your customers: Seamless product mappings, excellent UX, and deep integration with your existing product.

More than 400 teams already use Nango in production. If you have feedback, we would love to hear it on our [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack).
