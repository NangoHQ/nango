Nango is the leading provider of **API access for AI agents & products**. It is designed for developers building integrations for their users, with full flexibility.

## Integration primitives

Nango provides a set of powerful primitives that you can combine to build any integration:

- **Auth**: Managed API authorization for 500+ APIs
- **Proxy**: Query APIs via Nango with credentials injection
- **Functions**: Build custom integrations in code with a scalable runtime

## Flexible use cases

Flexible by design, Nango never constrains the integrations you need to build:
- Tool calling
- MCP
- Data syncing & RAG
- Triggers
- Real-time webhooks
- Per customer configs
- Unified APIs
- More

## Approach & Benefits

We believe teams should build their own integrations, but with better primitives.

By leveraging Nango, developers can save weeks per integration:
- **Fast**: Avoid rebuilding hard infrastructure & per-API tools.
- **Flexible**: code-based integrations with full access to external APIs.
- **Dev-centric**: API-first & infrastructure as code for mature development workflows.
- **Reliable**: Production-ready primitives from day one.
- **Secure**: Secure handling of credentials and user data.
- **Observable**: Full visibility into every API interaction.
- **Modular**: Use only what you need, without vendor lock-in.
- **Proven at scale**: Powers millions of users for companies like Replit, Linux, etc.
