Prunes synced records for a given connection and model using cursor-based pagination.

## What is pruning?

Pruning empties the record payload while preserving the record metadata.
This is useful for compliance requirements, ensuring Nango doesn't hold onto your records data while maintaining the ability to track record state. The payload can be restored by re-syncing the data.

<Tip>
Pruning is not the same as marking a record as deleted from the external API.
This endpoint prunes data from Nango’s cache only. It does not delete anything on the external API, and it is not the same as [detecting a deletion from the source](/guides/use-cases/syncs#deletion-detection).

If you need to tell your customers that a record was deleted on the external API while keeping its last-known payload in cache, use `batchDelete` or `deleteRecordsFromPreviousExecutions` in your sync functions instead.
</Tip>

## Cursor behavior

Records are pruned up to and including the specified `until_cursor` value. Use the `_nango_metadata.cursor` value from the record you want to prune up to.

## Response

<Tip>
The `has_more` field indicates whether there are potentially more records to prune. When `true`, make another request with the same `until_cursor` to continue pruning. When `false`, all records up to the cursor have been pruned.
</Tip>

```json
{
  "count": 150,
  "has_more": true
}
```
