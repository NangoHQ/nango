Deletes synced records for a given connection and model using cursor-based pagination.

## Deletion modes

- **`soft`**: Empties the record payload and marks as deleted. The record metadata is preserved, including `_nango_metadata` fields.
- **`hard`**: Permanently removes the record entries from Nango.

## Cursor behavior

Records are deleted up to and including the specified `until_cursor` value. Use the `_nango_metadata.cursor` value from the record you want to delete up to.

## Response

<Tip>
The `has_more` field indicates whether there are potentially more records to delete. When `true`, make another request with the same `until_cursor` to continue deletion. When `false`, all records up to the cursor have been deleted.
</Tip>

```json
{
  "count": 150,
  "has_more": true
}
```
