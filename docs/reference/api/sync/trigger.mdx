## Triggering one-off syncs

This is especially useful if you e.g. changed the metadata for the connection and now want to re-import data.

Use `reset` to clear the checkpoint and re-fetch all data, or `reset` with `emptyCache` to start completely fresh. See the [checkpoints guide](/implementation-guides/use-cases/syncs/checkpoints#re-syncing-resetting-checkpoints-and-the-cache) for details.
