title: 'Create a connect session'
openapi: 'POST /connect/sessions'
---

Creates a short-lived connect session (30m).
The returned token can be used for instance to create connections through Connect UI.

You can attach connection-level tags to the session via the `tags` field. These tags are copied onto the created connection and included in auth webhooks.

Most apps start with these tags: `end_user_id`, `end_user_email`, `organization_id`.
