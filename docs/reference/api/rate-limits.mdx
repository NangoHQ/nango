title: 'Rate limits'
---

The Nango API is rate-limited to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage across all clients. The rate limit is enforced on a per-account basis, with a fixed window of time and a maximum number of requests allowed within that window.

Those headers are sent back with every API response:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit` indicates the maximum number of requests a client can make within the rate limit window.
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining` shows how many requests are remaining before the limit is reached.
- `X-RateLimit-Reset` provides a Unix timestamp representing the time at which the current rate limit window resets, and the remaining request count is replenished.

If a client exceeds the rate limit, the API will respond with a 429 `Too Many Requests` status code. In this case, the `Retry-After` header is included, indicating the number of seconds the client should wait before making another request to avoid being rate-limited.
