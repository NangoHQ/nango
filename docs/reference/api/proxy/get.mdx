### API request

The path, query params, and headers you send to the Proxy are all passed on to the external API, except for the configuration headers mentioned here:
* Authorization: See [Nango API Authentication](/reference/api/authentication). Nango will add a new Authorization header for the external API as needed.
* Provider-Config-Key
* Connection-Id
* Retries
* Base-Url-Override: provide an API base URL when the base API is not listed in the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) or it needs to be overridden

### API response

The response from the external API is passed back to you exactly as Nango gets it:
* Response code
* Response headers
* Response body
