### Install the Nango CLI

Install the Nango CLI globally:
```bash
npm install nango -g
```

In the folder where you want your integration folder (e.g. root of your project), run:
```bash
nango init nango-integrations
```

This creates the `./nango-integrations` folder with some initial configuration and an example
sync script. The `nango-integrations` directory looks like this:
```
nango-integrations/
├── .env
├── index.ts
└── demo-github-integration # this is the integration unique ID and must match an integration ID in the UI
    └── syncs/
        └── github-issue-example.ts
```

### CLI Authentication

Add the following env vars. We recommend that you have a `.env` file in `./nango-integrations`:
```bash
NANGO_SECRET_KEY_PROD='<prod-secret-key>'
NANGO_SECRET_KEY_DEV='<dev-secret-key>'
```

Get your `prod` and `dev` secret keys from the [Environment Settings tab](https://app.nango.dev/environment-settings) (toggle between the `prod` and `dev` environment in the left nav bar).

<Info>
For self-hosting, set the `NANGO_HOSTPORT` env variable to `http://localhost:3003` (for local development) or your instance's URL.

## All CLI commands & command details

Check out all CLI commands by running:
```bash
nango
```

Get details about a specific command by running:
```bash
nango [command] --help
```

## Interactive Mode

The Nango CLI includes an interactive mode that prompts you for missing arguments. For example, if you run `nango create` without specifying the function type, integration, or name, the CLI will prompt you for them.

This mode is enabled by default when you're in an interactive terminal session.

### Usage Examples

**Interactive Usage:**

If you run a command without all the required arguments, the CLI will prompt you for them.

```bash
# Running "nango create" without arguments
$ nango create

? What type of function do you want to create?
❯   sync
    action
    on-event
```

**Non-Interactive (Explicit) Usage:**

You can provide all arguments upfront to bypass the interactive prompts. This is ideal for scripting.

```bash
nango create --sync --integration my-api --name get-contacts
```

### Disabling Interactive Mode

You can disable interactive mode in two ways:

1.  **Using a flag:** Pass the `--no-interactive` flag to any command.
    ```bash
    nango create --no-interactive
    ```
2.  **In a CI environment:** Interactive mode is automatically disabled when the `CI` environment variable is set. This is the standard way to detect CI/CD environments.

### Backwards Compatibility

Interactive mode is fully backward compatible. If you provide all the required arguments for a command, the CLI will not prompt you for anything and will behave exactly as it did before.

## Flags & environment variables

Global command flags:

```bash
# Command flag to auto-confirm all prompts (useful for CI).
# Note: Destructive changes (like removing a sync or renaming a model) requires confirmation, even when --auto-confirm is set. To bypass this restriction, the --allow-destructive flag can be passed to nango deploy.
--auto-confirm

# Command flag to disable interactive mode.
--no-interactive

# Command flag to skip automatic package.json updates and package installs.
# Recommended in CI and monorepos where dependency updates are managed elsewhere.
--no-dependency-update
```

Environment variables:
```bash
# Recommendation: in a ".env" file in ./nango-integrations.

# Authenticates the CLI (get the keys in the dashboard's Environment Settings).
NANGO_SECRET_KEY_DEV=xxxx-xxx-xxxx
NANGO_SECRET_KEY_PROD=xxxx-xxx-xxxx

# Nango's instance URL (OSS: change to http://localhost:3003 or your instance URL).
NANGO_HOSTPORT=https://api.nango.dev # Default value

# How to handle CLI upgrades ("prompt", "auto" or "ignore").
NANGO_CLI_UPGRADE_MODE=prompt # Default value

# Whether to prompt before deployments.
# Note: Destructive changes (like removing a sync or renaming a model) requires confirmation, even when NANGO_DEPLOY_AUTO_CONFIRM is set to true. To bypass this restriction, the --allow-destructive flag can be passed to nango deploy.
NANGO_DEPLOY_AUTO_CONFIRM=false # Default value

# Skip automatic dependency updates and package installation.
# Equivalent to passing --no-dependency-update.
NANGO_CLI_DEPENDENCY_UPDATE=true # Default value
```

## Dependency management

For Zero YAML projects, the CLI can keep required dev dependencies (for example `nango` and related tooling) in sync and run package installation when needed.

### `--no-dependency-update`

Use `--no-dependency-update` to disable automatic `package.json` updates and dependency installs:

```bash
nango deploy dev --no-dependency-update
```

This is especially useful when:

- your CI pipeline should not modify files
- your monorepo manages dependencies at the workspace root
- you want full control over when `install` runs

In CI, dependency updates are automatically disabled to avoid hanging. Passing `--no-dependency-update` explicitly is still recommended to make intent clear and silence the warning.

<Warning>
When dependency updates are disabled, Nango will not install dependencies for you. Ensure dependencies are already installed before running commands.
</Warning>

## Package manager support

Nango supports all major JavaScript package managers. The CLI automatically detects and uses your package manager for installs. Detection works from the current directory upward (monorepo-aware), in this order:

1. `package.json` `packageManager` field (Corepack standard)
2. lock files (`pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `bun.lockb` / `bun.lock`)
3. fallback to `npm`

Supported managers are `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, and `bun`.
