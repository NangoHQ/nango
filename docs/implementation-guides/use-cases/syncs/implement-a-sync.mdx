Syncs let you continuously sync data from external APIs. They work with any data the external API exposes and keep a cached copy in Nango that stays up to date.

## When to use syncs

Syncs are ideal when you want to:
- **Store a copy** of external API data in your app and keep it up to date
- **Detect changes** in external APIs that don't offer webhooks
- **Combine polling and webhooks** for a reliable, real-time stream of changes

Common examples:
- Syncing contacts, companies, or deals from CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce, Attio, etc.)
- Syncing files from drives (Google Drive, SharePoint, Box, etc.)
- Syncing call transcripts from video recorders (Gong, Fathom, Zoom, etc.)

You can implement two-way syncs by combining syncs with [Actions](/implementation-guides/use-cases/actions/implement-an-action).

## Key facts

- Syncs run in Nango's infrastructure, powered by [Functions](/guides/primitives/functions)
- You control the code: which data to fetch, transformations, data models, etc.
- All platform features are available: data validation, per-customer config, retries, rate-limit handling, and pagination
- Syncs run in the context of each [Connection](/guides/primitives/auth#what-is-a-connection%3F) (API key or access token of your user)
- Syncs can be **incremental** (only fetch changed data) or **full refresh** (always fetch all data)
- Synced data is cached in Nango (encrypted at rest and in transit)
- Nango detects changes (additions, updates, deletes) and sends webhooks to your app
- You set the polling frequency (15 seconds minimum interval)
- All sync runs and API requests are logged in [Nango's logs](/guides/platform/observability)

Syncs are defined on the integration (e.g., GitHub, Google Drive) by implementing a [Function](/guides/primitives/functions) with the sync's logic. Nango then executes the sync for each Connection of this integration, letting you customize logic and frequency per customer if needed.

This guide covers:

- [How to use a sync](#how-to-use-a-sync)

If you are using a pre-built reference implementation sync, you can [skip to using a sync](#how-to-use-a-sync).

## Syncs in detail

### Incremental vs. full-refresh syncs

Nango supports both modes and automatically detects changes to records in either.

| Mode | Description | Best for |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Incremental** | Only fetches data changed since last execution | Large datasets; requires API support for querying modified records |
| **Full refresh** | Retrieves entire dataset each execution | APIs without last-modified filtering; fallback option |

Set `syncType: 'incremental'` or `syncType: 'full'` in your sync definition.

### Deletion detection

Nango can detect deleted records on external APIs. For incremental syncs, this requires specific API support. For full-refresh syncs, deletes are always detectable.

Follow the [deletion detection guide](/implementation-guides/use-cases/syncs/deletion-detection) for implementation details.

### Real-time syncs with webhooks

Nango supports real-time syncs using [webhooks](/implementation-guides/use-cases/webhooks-from-external-apis). You can rely entirely on webhooks or combine them with polling to ensure you never miss data.

Follow the [real-time syncs guide](/implementation-guides/use-cases/syncs/realtime-syncs) to add real-time support.

## How to build a sync

<Info>
    If you are using a function template, you can [skip to using a sync](#how-to-use-a-sync).
</Info>

### Step 1 - Initial Functions setup

If you don't have a `nango-integrations` folder yet, follow the [initial Functions setup guide](/implementation-guides/platform/functions/functions-setup) first.

Otherwise, you can skip to the next step.

### Step 2 - Start dev mode

Before you plan to modify your integration functions, run:

```bash
nango dev # Keep the tab open
```

This command starts a process that continuously compiles your integration functions and prints code syntax errors.

### Step 3 - Create the sync file

In your `nango-integrations` folder, create the file for your new sync function.

Sync files should be within a `syncs` folder, which is nested under the integration's folder.

For example, if you want to create a new sync to sync `contacts` from `salesforce`, your structure should look like this:

```
nango-integrations/
├── .nango
├── .env
├── index.ts
├── package.json
└── salesforce # this is the integration id and must match an integration id in your Nango dashboard
    └── syncs/
        └── salesforce-contacts.ts # this is the name of your sync
```

In your sync file, paste the following scaffold:

```ts salesforce-contacts.ts lines
import { createSync } from 'nango';
import * as z from 'zod';

const MyObject = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  first_name: z.string(),
  last_name: z.string(),
  email: z.string(),
});

export default createSync({
    description: `<Description of your sync>`,
    version: '1.0.0', // Version, increment it when you release a new version
    endpoints: [{ method: 'GET', path: '/<integration>/<object-name>', group: '<Group>' }],
    frequency: 'every hour', // Default sync interval
    autoStart: true, // Should the sync start immediately when a new connection is created?
    syncType: 'full', // incremental or full (full refresh or incremental sync)
    trackDeletes: true, // detect deletes? See separate implementation guide
    models: {
        MyObject: MyObject,
    },
    exec: async (nango) => {
        // Integration code goes here.
    },
});
```

Also import your new sync file in your `index.ts` file:

```typescript index.ts
import './salesforce/syncs/salesforce-contacts';
```

### Step 4 - Implement your sync

In the `exec` method, implement the logic of your sync. Edit `MyObject` to contain the properties you need.

The following can help you with your implementation:
- [`nango` object reference](/reference/functions) to understand the SDK methods available in syncs
- [Our integration templates repo](https://www.nango.dev/templates) has 800+ examples of syncs & actions implemented by Nango
- [Leveraging AI agents guide](/implementation-guides/platform/functions/leverage-ai-agents) to build syncs with claude code, cursor & other AI agents

Example implementation of the Salesforce contacts sync:

```ts salesforce-contacts.ts lines
import { createSync } from 'nango';
import * as z from 'zod';

const SalesforceContact = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  first_name: z.string(),
  last_name: z.string(),
  email: z.string(),
});

export default createSync({
  description: `Fetches contacts from Salesforce`,
  version: '1.0.0',
  endpoints: [{ method: 'GET', path: '/salesforce/contacts', group: 'Contacts' }],
  frequency: 'every hour',
  autoStart: true,
  syncType: 'full',
  models: {
    SalesforceContact: SalesforceContact,
  },
  exec: async (nango) => {
    const query = buildQuery(nango.lastSyncDate);
    await fetchAndSaveRecords(nango, query);
    await nango.log('Sync run completed!');
  },
});
export type NangoSyncLocal = Parameters<(typeof sync)['exec']>[0];

function buildQuery(lastSyncDate?: Date): string {
    let baseQuery = `SELECT Id, FirstName, LastName, Email, AccountId, LastModifiedDate FROM Contact`;

    if (lastSyncDate) { // Only fetch the new data.
        baseQuery += ` WHERE LastModifiedDate > ${lastSyncDate.toISOString()}`;
    }

    return baseQuery;
}

async function fetchAndSaveRecords(nango: NangoSyncLocal, query: string) {
    let endpoint = '/services/data/v53.0/query';

    while (true) {
        const response = await nango.get({
            endpoint: endpoint,
            params: endpoint === '/services/data/v53.0/query' ? { q: query } : {}
        });

        const mappedRecords = mapContacts(response.data.records);

        await nango.batchSave(mappedRecords, 'SalesforceContact'); // Saves records to Nango cache.

        if (response.data.done) {
            break;
        }

        endpoint = response.data.nextRecordsUrl;
    }
    await nango.deleteRecordsFromPreviousExecutions('SalesforceContact')
}

function mapContacts(records: any[]): SalesforceContact[] {
    return records.map((record: any) => {
        return {
            id: record.Id as string,
            first_name: record.FirstName,
            last_name: record.LastName,
            email: record.Email,
            account_id: record.AccountId,
            last_modified_date: record.LastModifiedDate
        };
    });
}
```

In this integration function, the following Nango utilities are used:
- `nango.lastSyncDate` is the last date at which the sync has run
- `await nango.batchSave()` to persist external data in Nango's cache
- `await nango.get()` to perform an API request (automatically authenticated by Nango)
- `await nango.log()` to write custom log messages

### Step 5 - Test your sync locally

Easily test your integration functions locally as you develop them with the `dryrun` function of the CLI:

```bash
nango dryrun salesforce-contacts '<CONNECTION-ID>'
```

You can also enable performance diagnostics to monitor memory usage and CPU metrics:

```bash
nango dryrun salesforce-contacts '<CONNECTION-ID>' --diagnostics
```

The `--diagnostics` flag displays detailed performance metrics including average and peak memory usage (RSS, heap, external) and CPU utilization, which is useful for performance tuning and identifying memory leaks.

<Warning>
Local diagnostics are indicative only and do not fully represent CPU/memory consumption when run by Nango Cloud. Performance characteristics may differ between local and cloud environments.
</Warning>

To learn more about all the options for the dryrun, run: `nango dryrun --help`.

Because this is a dry run, syncs won't persist data in Nango. Instead, the retrieved data is printed to the console.

<Tip>
    By default, `dryrun` retrieves connections from your `dev` environment. You can change this with the `-e` flag.
</Tip>

### Step 6 - Deploy your sync

To run your sync in Nango, you need to deploy it to an environment in your Nango account.

To deploy all integrations in your `nango-integrations` folder, run:
```bash
nango deploy dev # dev is the name of the environment to which you are deploying
```

To only deploy a single sync, use the `--sync` parameter:
```bash
nango deploy --sync salesforce-contacts dev
```

Run `nango deploy -h` for more options to deploy only parts of your integrations.

To fetch the synced data in your product, follow the steps in the next setion.

<Tip>
    Most teams automate deployments to production in their CI.

## How to use a sync

### Pre-built integration templates

For common use cases, [pre-built integration templates](https://www.nango.dev/templates) are available to help you get started fast.

Select your integration in the _Integrations_ tab, and navigate to the _Endpoints_ tab. Available pre-built sync integrations will appear in the endpoint list. Select the relevant one and enable it with the toggle.

Nango will automatically sync the corresponding data in the background for each relevant connection.

Integration templates are a starting point. You will likely need to [customize them](/implementation-guides/platform/functions/customize-template) or [create your own custom sync](#how-to-build-a-sync).

### Step 1 - Setup webhooks from Nango

Nango sends webhook notifications to your backend whenever new data is available for a connection & sync combination.

Set these up by following the [implement webhooks from Nango](/implementation-guides/platform/webhooks-from-nango) guide.

When the sync finishes, Nango will send you a webhooks with [this payload](/implementation-guides/platform/webhooks-from-nango#sync-webhooks).

### Step 2 - Fetch the latest data from Nango

After receiving a Nango webhook, fetch the latest records using the backend SDK ([reference](/reference/sdks/node#get-records)) or API ([reference](/reference/api/sync/records-list)).

Use the `modifiedAfter` timestamp from the webhook payload as a parameter in your request to fetch only the modified records.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="cURL (standard endpoint)">
        ```bash
        curl -G https://api.nango.dev/records \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ENVIRONMENT-SECRET-KEY>' \
        --header 'Provider-Config-Key: <providerConfigKey-in-webhook-payload>' \
        --header 'Connection-Id: <connectionId-in-webhook-payload>' \
        --data-urlencode 'model=<model-in-webhook-payload>' \
        --data-urlencode 'modified_after=<modifiedAfter-in-webhook-payload>' \
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Node SDK">
        ```ts
        import { Nango }  from '@nangohq/node';

        const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<ENVIRONMENT-SECRET-KEY>' });

        const result = await nango.listRecords({
            providerConfigKey: '<providerConfigKey-in-webhook-payload>',
            connectionId: '<connectionId-in-webhook-payload>',
            model: '<model-in-webhook-payload>',
            modifiedAfter: '<modifiedAfter-in-webhook-payload>'
        });
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

This returns an array of records conforming to the specified data model.

Each record contains useful metadata automatically generated by Nango:

```json
{
    records:
        [
            {
                id: 123,
                ..., // Fields as specified in the model you queried
                _nango_metadata: {
                    deleted_at: null,
                    last_action: 'ADDED',
                    first_seen_at: '2023-09-18T15:20:35.941305+00:00',
                    last_modified_at: '2023-09-18T15:20:35.941305+00:00',
                    cursor: 'MjAyNC0wMy0wNFQwNjo1OTo1MS40NzE0NDEtMDU6MDB8fDE1Y2NjODA1LTY0ZDUtNDk0MC1hN2UwLTQ1ZmM3MDQ5OTdhMQ=='
                }
            },
            ...
        ],
    next_cursor: "Y3JlYXRlZF9hdF4yMDIzLTExLTE3VDExOjQ3OjE0LjQ0NyswMjowMHxpZF4xYTE2MTYwMS0yMzk5LTQ4MzYtYWFiMi1mNjk1ZWI2YTZhYzI"
}
```

#### Cursor-based synchronization

In practice, webhook notifications can be missed, and relying solely on the webhook payload to fetch modified records can cause you to miss some updates.

A more reliable way of keeping track of how far you've synced records (for each connection & sync combination) is to rely on record **cursors**.

Each record comes with a synchronization cursor in `_nango_metadata.cursor`. Nango uses cursors internally to keep a chronological list of record modifications.

Each time you fetch records, you should store the `cursor` of the last record you fetched to remember how far you've synced (for each connection & sync combination).

The next time you fetch records, pass in the cursor of the last-fetched record to only receive records modified after that record:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="cURL (standard endpoint)">
        ```bash
        curl -G https://api.nango.dev/records \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ENVIRONMENT-SECRET-KEY>' \
        --header 'Provider-Config-Key: <providerConfigKey-in-webhook-payload>' \
        --header 'Connection-Id: <connectionId-in-webhook-payload>' \
        --data-urlencode 'model=<model-in-webhook-payload>' \
        --data-urlencode 'cursor=<cursor-of-last-fetched-record>' \
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Node SDK">
        ```ts
        import { Nango }  from '@nangohq/node';

        const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<ENVIRONMENT-SECRET-KEY>' });

        const result = await nango.listRecords({
            providerConfigKey: '<providerConfigKey-in-webhook-payload>',
            connectionId: '<connectionId-in-webhook-payload>',
            model: '<model-in-webhook-payload>',
            cursor: '<cursor-of-last-fetched-record>'
        });
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

So, the overall logic for cursor-based synchronization should be:
1. Receive a webhook notification from Nango
2. Query your database for the cursor of the last-fetched record
3. Fetch the modified records (passing the cursor)
4. Store the modified records
5. Store the last-fetched record cursor
