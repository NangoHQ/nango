Building custom integrations for Nango is much faster when using AI tools. This guide shows you how to leverage Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Gemini, or Codex to build high-quality integrations quickly.

## Automated Integrations Building

The fastest way to build Nango integrations is using our automated integration builder. With a single command, you can install everything needed to generate a fully working action through an interactive AI workflow.

This uses [prpm](https://prpm.dev) to install pre-built workflows directly into your development environment.

<Tip>
[prpm](https://prpm.dev) (Prompt Package Manager) is a universal package manager for AI tool configurations. It lets you discover, install, and share prompts, skills, and agents across AI development platforms like Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and Codex—all with a single CLI.
</Tip>

## Quick Start

### Claude
```bash
npx prpm install collections/nango-integration-builder --as claude
claude
/build-actions
```

### Gemini CLI
<Note>
For Gemini, you need to set `GEMINI_SANDBOX=true` in your `.env` file or export it in your environment before running the CLI.
</Note>

```bash
npx prpm install collections/nango-integration-builder --as gemini
gemini
/build-actions
```

### Cursor CLI
```bash
npx prpm install collections/nango-integration-builder --as cursor
cursor-agent
/build-actions
```
### Cursor IDE
```bash
npx prpm install collections/nango-integration-builder --as cursor
code .
/build-actions
```

### Codex
```bash
npx prpm install collections/nango-integration-builder --as codex
codex
build-actions
```

### VS Code With Copilot
```bash
npx prpm install collections/nango-integration-builder --as copilot
# open the VS Code Application
build-actions
```

### Using the Builder

The builder will enter **Interactive Mode** and prompt you for:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Integration ID** | Yes | Which integration to build for (e.g., `hubspot`, `salesforce`, `slack`) |
| **Connection ID** | No | A connection ID for testing. If not provided, one will be auto-discovered |
| **Use Case Summary** | Recommended | Brief description of what the action does |
| **Action Inputs** | Recommended | What data the action should accept as arguments |
| **Action Outputs** | Recommended | What data the action should return |
| **Action Name** | Optional | Suggested name for the action |
| **API Reference** | Optional | Link to relevant API documentation |
| **Test Input** | Optional | Sample JSON input for testing |

### Example Input

```
Integration ID: hubspot
Connection ID: my-hubspot-connection
Use Case: Creates a new contact in the CRM
Inputs: firstName, lastName, email
Outputs: contactId, createdAt
Action Name: create-contact
API Reference: https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/contacts
Test Input: {"firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}
```

### What Gets Generated

Once you provide your input, the agent automatically:

1. **Generates the action code** - Creates a complete, fully working action implementation
2. **Creates a full test suite** - Writes comprehensive tests for your action
3. **Validates with dry run** - Runs `nango dryrun` to verify the action works correctly against your connection
4. **Iterates on failures** - If tests or dry run fail, the agent automatically debugs and fixes issues

You'll end up with a fully tested, working action ready to deploy.

<Tip>
The more detail you provide, the better the generated action will be. Include API documentation links when available.
