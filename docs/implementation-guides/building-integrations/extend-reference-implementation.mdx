Nango publishes reference implementations for the most popular APIs and use cases. Reference implementations are a starting point for your custom integrations to reuse and extend.

You can find all 600+ reference implementations on the [reference implementations GitHub repo](https://www.nango.dev/templates).

This guide walks you through how you can extend and customize them.

## How to extend a reference implementation

### Step 1 - Initial Functions setup

If you don't have a `nango-integrations` folder yet, follow the [initial Functions setup guide](/implementation-guides/building-integrations/functions-setup) first.

Otherwise, you can skip to the next step.

### Step 2 - Download the reference implementation code

Copy the code of the reference implementation into your own `nango-integrations` folder.

You can either copy an entire integration folder (e.g., `github`) or copy individual sync and action files. If you copy individual files, make sure you also copy imported functions that may be in other files.

All reference implementation files are available in our [reference implementations GitHub repo](https://www.nango.dev/templates).

Import the new files in your `index.ts` file.

### Step 4 - Customize the implementation

Edit the sync and action functions as required for your integration.

You may want to reference:
- [Implement a sync guide](/implementation-guides/syncs/implement-a-sync)
- [Implement an action guide](/implementation-guides/actions/implement-an-action)

These two guides explain the SDK available in custom sync and action functions. They also explain how to test your functions locally and how to deploy them.

<Info>
If a custom sync or action function name conflicts with a reference implementation name, the custom function will override the reference implementation in the Nango UI (once you deploy your custom integrations to Nango).
