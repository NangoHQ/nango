Nango publishes integration templates for the most popular APIs and use cases. Integration templates are a starting point for your custom integrations to reuse and customize.

You can find all 800+ integration templates on the [integration templates GitHub repo](https://www.nango.dev/templates).

This guide walks you through how you can customize them.

## How to customize an integration template

### Step 1 - Initial Functions setup

If you don't have a `nango-integrations` folder yet, follow the [initial Functions setup guide](/implementation-guides/building-integrations/functions-setup) first.

Otherwise, you can skip to the next step.

### Step 2 - Download the integration template code

Use the CLI to clone the integration template. 
You can clone an entire integration folder (e.g. `github`), subfolders with a specific type of functions (e.g. `github/actions`) or individual functions (e.g. `github/actions/list-repos` action).
The CLI will make sure to also clone all the other files that are imported in the cloned files.

```
nango clone github                              # Clones an entire github integration folder
nango clone github/actions                      # Clones all github actions
nango clone github/actions/list-repos           # Clones just the list-repos action
```

You can also download the integration template files manually from our [integration templates GitHub repo](https://www.nango.dev/templates).
If you do that, make sure to also copy imported functions that may be in other files and import the new files in your `index.ts` file.

### Step 3 - Customize the implementation

Edit the sync and action functions as required for your integration.

You may want to reference:
- [Implement a sync guide](/implementation-guides/syncs/implement-a-sync)
- [Implement an action guide](/implementation-guides/actions/implement-an-action)

These two guides explain the SDK available in custom sync and action functions. They also explain how to test your functions locally and how to deploy them.

<Info>
If a custom sync or action function name conflicts with an integration template name, the custom function will override the integration template in the Nango UI (once you deploy your custom integrations to Nango).
