Building custom integrations for Nango is much faster when using AI tools. This guide shows you how to leverage AI tooling to build high-quality integrations quickly.

## Install the Nango function builder skill

Install Nango's skill pack into your development environment:

```bash
npx skills add NangoHQ/skills
```

This adds `nango-function-builder`, which includes guidance for building both [Actions](/implementation-guides/use-cases/actions/implement-an-action) and [Syncs](/implementation-guides/use-cases/syncs/implement-a-sync).

<Note>
If your coding agent is already running, restart it after installing the skill so it can load the new instructions.
</Note>

## Use it with your coding agent

The `nango-function-builder` skill is loaded automatically when using popular coding agents/tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, VS Code with Copilot, Opencode, and more).

Tell your agent what you want to build. You can start with a simple prompt to build an [Action](/implementation-guides/use-cases/actions/implement-an-action): 

```
I want to build a Nango action that will get specified Slack channel information.
```

However, the more information you give the agent up-front, the better the initial version of the [Action](/implementation-guides/use-cases/actions/implement-an-action) is going to be: 

```
I want to build a Nango action that will get Slack channel information.

Integration ID: slack
Connection ID: my-slack-connection
Inputs: channel_id
Outputs: id, name, is_private
API Reference: https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.info
```

Similarly, a prompt to build a [Sync](/implementation-guides/use-cases/syncs/implement-a-sync) could look like this:

```
I want to build a Nango sync that will store all Figma projects.

Integration ID: figma
Connection ID: my-figma-connection
Frequency: every hour
Inputs: team_id
Outputs: Project model with fields id, name, last_modified
API Reference: https://www.figma.com/developers/api#projects-endpoints
```

### What Gets Generated

Once you provide your input, your agent typically:

1. **Generates the function code** - Creates a complete action or sync implementation
2. **Creates a full test suite** - Writes comprehensive tests
3. **Validates with dry run** - Runs `nango dryrun` to verify against your connection
4. **Iterates on failures** - Automatically debugs and fixes issues

You'll end up with a fully tested, working function ready to deploy.

<Tip>
The more detail you provide, the better the generated function will be. Include API documentation links when available.
