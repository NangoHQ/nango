Building custom integrations for Nango is much faster when using AI tools. This guide shows you how to leverage AI tooling to build high-quality integrations quickly.

## Automated Integrations Building

The fastest way to build Nango integrations is using our automated function builder. With a single command, you can install everything needed to generate a fully working sync or action through an interactive AI workflow.

This uses [prpm](https://prpm.dev) to install pre-built workflows directly into your development environment.

<Tip>
[prpm](https://prpm.dev) (Prompt Package Manager) is a universal package manager for AI tool configurations. It lets you discover, install, and share prompts, skills, and agents across AI development platforms with a single CLI.

## Quick Start

### [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)
```bash
npx prpm install collections/nango-function-builder --as claude
claude
/build-actions
```

### [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/)
<Note>
For Gemini, you need to set `GEMINI_SANDBOX=true` in your `.env` file or export it in your environment before running the CLI.
</Note>

```bash
npx prpm install collections/nango-function-builder --as gemini
gemini
/build-actions
```

### [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli)
```bash
npx prpm install collections/nango-function-builder --as cursor
cursor-agent
/build-actions
```
### [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.com/)
```bash
npx prpm install collections/nango-function-builder --as cursor
code .
/build-actions
```

### [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/)
```bash
npx prpm install collections/nango-function-builder --as codex
codex
build-actions
```

### [VS Code With Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview)
```bash
npx prpm install collections/nango-function-builder --as copilot
# open the VS Code Application
build-actions
```

### [Opencode](https://opencode.ai/)
```bash
npx prpm install collections/nango-function-builder --as opencode
opencode
/build-actions
```

### [Droid By Factory](https://factory.ai/)
```bash
npx prpm install collections/nango-function-builder --as droid
droid
/build-actions
```

### Using the Builder

The builder will first ask what you want to build:

1. **Action** - One-time operations (create, update, delete, get)
2. **Sync** - Continuous data synchronization (fetch records periodically)

### Example Inputs

**Action Example:**
```
Integration ID: slack
Connection ID: my-slack-connection
Use Case: Gets channel information
Inputs: channel_id
Outputs: id, name, is_private
API Reference: https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.info
```

**Sync Example:**
```
Integration ID: figma
Connection ID: my-figma-connection
Model Name: Project
Frequency: every hour
Sync Type: full
Metadata: {"team_id": "1234567890"}
API Reference: https://www.figma.com/developers/api#projects-endpoints
```

### What Gets Generated

Once you provide your input, the agent automatically:

1. **Generates the function code** - Creates a complete action or sync implementation
2. **Creates a full test suite** - Writes comprehensive tests
3. **Validates with dry run** - Runs `nango dryrun` to verify against your connection
4. **Iterates on failures** - Automatically debugs and fixes issues

You'll end up with a fully tested, working function ready to deploy.

<Tip>
The more detail you provide, the better the generated function will be. Include API documentation links when available.
