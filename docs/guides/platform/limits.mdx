---

Nango Cloud has several resource limits to ensure platform stability and fair usage across all customers.

<Note>
For plan-specific limits, refer to the [pricing page](https://www.nango.dev/pricing) and the Usage & Billing page in your account.
</Note>

## API rate limits

Rate limits apply to API requests from your application to Nango:

| Plan | Requests per Minute |
| - | - |
| Free tier | 200 |
| Starter | 1,000 |
| Growth | 5,000 |
| Enterprise | Custom |

<Info>
If you exceed the rate limit, use the standard rate-limit headers to determine when to resume requests.

## Function execution limits

Different function types have varying execution and enqueuing time limits:

| Function Type | Max Execution Time |
| - | - |
| [Syncs](/guides/use-cases/syncs) | 24 hours |
| [Actions](/guides/use-cases/actions) | 15 minutes |
| [External webhooks](/guides/use-cases/webhooks) | 1 hour |

### Action output limits

Actions have a maximum output payload size of **2MB**. For large payloads, use the [Proxy](/guides/use-cases/proxy) instead.

## Data retention policies

Nango automatically manages data retention for records in the sync cache:

### Payload pruning (30 days)

If a record hasn't been updated for **30 days**, Nango automatically prunes its payload while preserving:
- Record ID
- Sync state
- Payload hash (for change detection)

The record still exists and Nango can detect future changes, but the data fields are no longer retrievable from the cache.

### Hard deletion (60 days)

If a sync hasn't executed for **60 days**, all associated records (payload + metadata) are permanently deleted.

<Note>
These policies ensure sensitive data isn't stored indefinitely. If you need to access record payloads long after updates (30+ days), please reach out in the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack).
</Note>

## Webhook limits

Webhooks sent from Nango to your application have the following limits:

- **Timeout**: 20 seconds
- **Retries**: 2 attempts

These limits apply to all webhook types: auth, syncs, async actions, and webhook forwards.

**Questions, problems, feedback?** Please reach out in the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack).
