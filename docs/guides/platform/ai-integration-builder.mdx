<Tip>
    **Quickstart:**
    1. Use Nango's documentation MCP: https://nango.dev/docs/mcp
    2. Install the function builder skill: `npx skills add NangoHQ/skills`
</Tip>

## Overview

Nango's AI builder generates and assists in implementing [Functions](/guides/primitives/functions) using the IDE and model of your choice. It feeds the necessary context to the model — Nango's interface, best coding practices, and testing patterns — so you can describe your use case and get production-ready code with minimal manual effort.

Unlike black-box integrations, Nango generates human-readable code that you can review, edit, and maintain.

## How it works

1. **Describe your use case** — what data to sync or action to perform
2. **Review generated code** — with proper error handling, pagination, and rate limiting
3. **Test against live API** — using connections you've set up on Nango
4. **Deploy** — tested Functions ready for production

The AI builder also generates mock-based tests for your CI/CD pipeline, and follows battle-tested patterns from hundreds of production integrations.

## Supported agents

Nango's function builder is distributed as a [Vercel skill](https://vercel.com/blog/agent-skills-explained-an-faq) and works with [18+ AI frameworks](https://vercel.com/changelog/introducing-skills-the-open-agent-skills-ecosystem) including Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Codex, OpenCode, and more.
