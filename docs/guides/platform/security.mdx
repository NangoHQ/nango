Nango is designed with security as a core principle. This page provides technical details about how Nango stores, encrypts, and manages API credentials.

## Credential storage

### What credentials are stored

Nango stores the following credential types depending on your API integrations:

- **OAuth tokens**: Access tokens, refresh tokens, and associated metadata
- **API keys**: For APIs using key-based authentication
- **Client credentials**: OAuth client IDs and secrets for your integrations
- **Connection configuration**: OAuth scopes, authorization parameters, and provider-specific settings

### Storage infrastructure

Nango Cloud stores all data in **AWS Aurora PostgreSQL** databases hosted in AWS. The database infrastructure includes:

- Encryption at rest using AWS-managed keys
- Automated backups with point-in-time recovery
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Network isolation within a private VPC

For self-hosted deployments, you control the database infrastructure and can apply your own security policies.

## Encryption

### Encryption at rest

All sensitive credentials are encrypted before being stored in the database using **AES-256-GCM** (Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode).

| Property | Value |
| - | - |
| Algorithm | AES-256-GCM |
| Key size | 256 bits (32 bytes) |
| IV size | 12 bytes (generated per encryption) |
| Auth tag size | 16 bytes |

### What is encrypted

The following data types are encrypted at rest:

- Connection credentials (OAuth tokens, API keys, etc.)
- OAuth client secrets (your integration credentials)
- Environment secret keys
- Environment variables

### Key management

- **Nango Cloud**: Encryption keys are securely managed by Nango. All credentials are encrypted at rest.
- **Self-hosted**: You must provide your own encryption key via the `NANGO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable to enable encryption at rest. Without this key, credentials are stored unencrypted.

<Warning>
**Self-hosted users**: Setting `NANGO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is required to encrypt credentials at rest. Without it, OAuth tokens and API keys are stored in plaintext.
</Warning>

<Note>
The encryption key must be a base64-encoded 256-bit (32-byte) key. Key rotation is not supported—changing the key after initial setup will cause decryption failures. Plan your key management accordingly.
</Note>

### Encryption in transit

All data transmitted to and from Nango is encrypted using TLS 1.2+. This includes:

- API requests between your application and Nango
- Requests from Nango to external APIs (using each provider's TLS configuration)
- Dashboard access

## Data retention

### Active connections

Credentials are stored for as long as the connection exists. You have full control over connection lifecycle:

- Create connections when users authorize integrations
- Delete connections at any time via the API or dashboard
- Connections can be programmatically managed through your application

### Retention after deletion

When a connection is deleted:

1. **Immediate soft delete**: Connection is marked as deleted and becomes inaccessible
2. **Associated data cleanup**: Syncs are stopped, and scheduled tasks are cancelled
3. **Hard delete after retention period**: Credentials and associated data are permanently removed from the database

The default retention period is **31 days**. For self-hosted deployments, this is configurable via the `CRON_DELETE_OLD_CONNECTIONS_MAX_DAYS` environment variable.

This retention period allows for:
- Recovery from accidental deletions
- Compliance with audit requirements
- Graceful handling of in-flight operations

### What is deleted

When a connection is permanently deleted, the following data is removed:

- All stored credentials (tokens, keys, secrets)
- Connection metadata and configuration
- Sync records associated with the connection
- Related job history and logs

## Deletion procedures

### User-initiated deletion

You can delete connections through:

- **Dashboard**: Navigate to the connection and click "Delete"
- **API**: Call the [delete connection endpoint](/reference/api/connection/delete)
- **SDK**: Use the `deleteConnection` method in any of our backend SDKs

### Automatic cleanup

Nango automatically cleans up:

- Expired OAuth sessions
- Expired connect session tokens
- Orphaned data from deleted integrations

### Data purge requests

For compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR), contact Nango support to request immediate data purges. We can expedite the deletion process when required by regulation.

## Access controls

### API authentication

Nango supports multiple authentication methods:

| Method | Use case | Token lifetime |
| - | - | - |
| Secret key | Server-to-server API access | Long-lived (until rotated) |
| Connect session token | Frontend auth flows | 30 minutes |
| Session cookie | Dashboard access | Session-based |

### Secret key security

- Secret keys are environment-specific (dev, prod, etc.)
- Keys can be rotated via the dashboard
- All API requests require a valid secret key in the `Authorization` header

### Environment isolation

Each [environment](/guides/platform/environments) in your Nango account is completely isolated:

- Separate credentials and connections
- Separate integration configurations
- Separate secret keys

This ensures your production data is never accessible from development environments.

### Audit logging

All credential access and modifications are logged:

- Connection creation and deletion
- Credential refresh operations
- API requests using credentials

Logs are available in the Nango dashboard and can be exported via [OpenTelemetry](/implementation-guides/platform/open-telemetry-export).

## Compliance

Nango maintains security practices aligned with industry standards:

- Regular security assessments
- Secure development lifecycle
- Incident response procedures
