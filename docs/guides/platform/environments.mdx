Environments help you segment your integration configuration and customer data across different stages of your development lifecycle.

## Overview

Each environment in your Nango account is completely isolated with its own:

- Integration configurations
- [Functions](/guides/primitives/functions)
- [Connections](/guides/primitives/auth)
- Environment-specific settings

<Info>
Each Nango account comes with **dev** and **prod** environments by default. Additional environments are available depending on your [pricing plan](https://www.nango.dev/pricing).

## Best practices

**Mirror your application environments**

We recommend creating Nango environments that match your application's deployment stages. For example:
- Local development → dev environment
- Staging → staging environment  
- Production → prod environment
- Demo → demo environment

**Deploy to specific environments**

When you deploy [Functions](/guides/primitives/functions), you always target a specific environment. This ensures changes are tested before reaching production.
