## Overview

**Nango Auth** lets your users connect 600+ external APIs to your product while Nango handles authorization, credential storage, refresh, and validation.

You embed a Nango-managed auth flow in your application. Once a connection is created, credentials are retrievable at scale or available to the rest of the Nango platform without ever passing through your codebase.

## How it works

**1. Embed the Nango Auth flow in your frontend**

```TypeScript
nango.openConnectUI({
  onEvent: (event) => {
    // Handle completion.
  },
});
```

<Frame caption="Example of the Auth UI">

</Frame>

**2. Fetch API credentials from your backend before making requests**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Typescript">
  ```TypeScript
    await nango.getConnection(integrationId, connectionId);
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Other languages (cURL)">

  ```bash
    curl \
      "https://api.nango.dev/connections/{connectionId}?integration_id={integrationId}" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer {nangoSecretKey}"
  ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
