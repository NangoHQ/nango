# Overview

To authenticate with nocrm.io, you will need:
1. **Account subdomain** – Your nocrm.io subdomain (e.g. `mycompany` for `https://mycompany.nocrm.io`).
2. **API Key** – A private key generated by an administrator from the admin section of your nocrm.io account.

This guide walks you through finding your subdomain and generating an API key.

### Prerequisites

- You must have a nocrm.io account with admin access to generate API keys.

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Finding your subdomain

Your account address is of the form `https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.nocrm.io`. The subdomain is the part before `.nocrm.io` (e.g. if your URL is `https://acme.nocrm.io`, your subdomain is `acme`). You can see it in the browser when you are logged in to nocrm.io.

#### Step 2: Obtaining your API key

1. From your account, click on your profile.
2. From the dropdown that is displayed, click **Admin Panel**.

#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **subdomain** and **API key**:

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with nocrm.io.
2. Enter your **subdomain** (e.g. `mycompany`) in the account subdomain field.
3. Enter your **API key** in the API key field.
4. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
