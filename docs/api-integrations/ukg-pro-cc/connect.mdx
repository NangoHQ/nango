# Overview

To authenticate with UKG Pro (Client Credentials), you will need:

1. **Client ID** – Unique identifier of the identity client provided by UKG customer support.
2. **Client Secret** – Client secret associated with the client ID, provided by UKG customer support.
3. **Identity Server** – Identity server for your tenant (e.g. `signin.ukg.net`, `signin.ultipro.com`), provided by UKG customer support.
4. **Tenant** – The tenant value from your UKG Pro Recruiting URL.
5. **Recruiting Application Domain** – The recruiting application domain (hostname) from your UKG Pro Recruiting URL.

This guide walks you through obtaining these values.

### Prerequisites

- Your organization must be registered with UKG.

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Getting the credentials from UKG support

The UKG Identity team registers your integration with UKG Pro Recruiting via an offline process. You need the following provided by UKG customer support:

- **Client ID** – Unique identifier of the identity client.
- **Client Secret** – Secret associated with the client ID.
- **Identity Server** – Identity server for your tenant (e.g. `signin.ukg.net`, `signin.ultipro.com`).

Request this authentication information from UKG customer support before setting up the connection.

#### Step 2: Identify tenant and recruiting application domain

Log in to your **UKG Pro Recruiting** account and check the URL in the browser address bar. You can identify:

- **Recruiting Application Domain** – The hostname of the Recruiting application (e.g. `recruiting.example.ultipro.com`).
- **Tenant** – The tenant value is the segment that follows the **first slash after the domain name** in the URL.

Example: for a URL like `https://recruiting.example.ultipro.com/UO32145HGOGOG/some-path`, the Recruiting Application Domain is `recruiting.example.ultipro.com` and the tenant is `UO32145HGOGOG`.

#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, **Identity Server**, **Tenant**, and **Recruiting Application Domain**:

1. Open the form where you need to connect UKG Pro (Client Credentials).
2. Enter **Identity Server** (e.g. `signin.ukg.net`), **Tenant**, and **Recruiting Application Domain** in their respective fields.
3. Enter **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in their respective fields.
4. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
