## 🚀 Quickstart

Connect to Outlook with Nango and see data flow in 2 minutes.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create the integration">
    In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Outlook_. Nango doesn't provide a test OAuth app for Outlook yet. You'll need to set up your own by following the setup guide linked below. After that, make sure to add the OAuth client ID, secret, and scopes in the integration settings in Nango.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Authorize Outlook">
    Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Outlook. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Call the Outlook API">
    Let's make your first request to the Outlook (Microsoft Graph) API (fetch the profile of the currently signed-in user). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
    <Tabs>
        <Tab title="cURL">

            ```bash
            curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/v1.0/me" \
              -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
              -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
              -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
            ```

        </Tab>

        <Tab title="Node">

        Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

        ```typescript
        import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

        const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

        const res = await nango.get({
            endpoint: '/v1.0/me',
            providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
            connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
        });

        console.log(res.data);
        ```
        </Tab>

    </Tabs>

    Or fetch credentials with the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Implement Nango in your app">
        Follow our [quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart/embed-in-your-app) to integrate Nango in your app.

        To obtain your own production credentials, follow the setup guide linked below.
