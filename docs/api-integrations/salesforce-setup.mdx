This guide shows you how to register your own app with Salesforce to obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Salesforce account.

## Creating a Connected App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up for a Salesforce developer edition account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Salesforce Developer Edition account](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup).

    <Note>Your Developer Edition account is **not** a Salesforce sandbox. If your end-users need to authorize a sandbox account, use the `salesforce-sandbox` integration in Nango instead.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Connected Apps">
    **Note:** Connected Apps are disabled by default in new Salesforce organizations. If your organization has already enabled this setting, skip to the next step.

    1. Log in to your Salesforce account
    2. Navigate to **Setup**. In the left menu, go to **Apps** → **External Client App Manager** → **Settings**
    3. Find the **Allow creation of connected apps** option then toggle it to enable **Connected Apps**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Connected App settings">
    1. Log in to your [Salesforce Developer Edition account](https://login.salesforce.com/)
    2. Navigate to **Setup**. In the left menu, go to **Apps** → **External Client App Manager** → **Settings**. Scroll to the bottom of the page, then click **New Connected App**
    3. Fill in the required basic information:
       - **Connected App Name**: Your app's name
       - **API Name**: This will auto-populate
       - **Contact Email**: Your email address
    4. Check the **Enable OAuth Settings** checkbox
    5. For **Callback URL**, enter: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
    6. Under **Selected OAuth Scopes**, add the permissions your app needs. At minimum, add:
       - `Access and manage your data (api)`
       - `Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)`

       For the full list of available scopes, see [Salesforce's OAuth scopes documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.remoteaccess_oauth_tokens_scopes.htm&type=5).
    7. Check the **Introspect All Tokens** option. This allows Nango to verify token validity since Salesforce doesn't share expiration dates.
    8. Leave the rest of the default settings unchanged
    9. Click **Save**, then **Continue**

    <Note>Changes can take up to 10 minutes to take effect.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain API credentials">
    1. After saving your changes, you'll be redirected to the Connected App detail page
    2. You may need to wait a few minutes for the app to be fully created
    3. Click **Manage Consumer Details** to view your credentials. You may be required to verify your identity
    4. Copy the **Consumer Key** (this is your Client ID) and **Consumer Secret** (this is your Client Secret)
    5. You will need these credentials when configuring your integration in Nango

    <Note>Salesforce calls the `client_id` and `client_secret` as **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure token settings">
    1. Under the **Connected Apps** dropdown, click **Manage Connected Apps**, then click the **Edit** button next to the application you just created
    2. Under **OAuth Policies**, set **Refresh Token Policy** to **Refresh token is valid until revoked** for long-lived access
    3. Click **Save**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>If you encounter an error that says `invalid_client_id`, [ensure your developer User's password does not contain any special characters](https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=906F00000009ABLIA2).</Note>

## Alternative: External Client Apps

In 2025, Salesforce released [External Client Apps](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.external_client_apps.htm&type=5) as an alternative authentication method. Nango fully supports this as well.

However, External Client Apps require packaging and end-users must install them in their Salesforce org to work. **For the most frictionless integration experience, Nango recommends using Connected Apps.**

To understand the differences, see [Salesforce's comparison guide](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_apps_and_external_client_apps_features.htm&language=en_US&type=5). For setup instructions, see [Salesforce's External Client Apps creation guide](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.create_a_local_external_client_app.htm&type=5).

You're now ready to integrate Salesforce with Nango. For more details on Salesforce's OAuth implementation, see the [Salesforce REST API documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_rest.htm).
