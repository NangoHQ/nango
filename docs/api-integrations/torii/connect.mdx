3. Select the permission type for your API key.
4. Set an expiration date: For security purposes, Torii recommends setting an expiration date when generating a new API key.
   - Set a longer period to avoid frequent key regeneration.
   - The key will become inactive on the chosen expiration date.
   - Torii will send an email reminder one month prior to the expiration date to remind you to generate a new **API Key**.
5. Add a description for your **API Key** and click **Generate Key**.
