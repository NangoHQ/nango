This guide shows you how to register your own app with Intercom to obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Intercom account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Intercom Developer account">
    Go to [Intercom's Developer signup page](https://app.intercom.com/a/developer-signup) and create a free account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new app in your Developer account">
    1. From your Developer Workspace, navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Developer Hub** > **Your apps**.
    2. Click **New app** and provide a name for your app.
    3. Select the **Workspace** to associate with the application, then click **Create app**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OAuth settings">
    In the app you just created:
    1. Navigate to the **Authentication** tab under **Configure** then click the **Edit** button.
    2. Check the **Use OAuth** checkbox, then go to **Redirect URLs** and add the following URL: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
    3. Select the appropriate permissions your app will need under **Permissions**.
    4. Save your changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain API credentials">
    1. Navigate to the **Basic Information** tab under **Configure**, then locate your app's credentials.
    2. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
    3. You will need these credentials when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API-specific notes

**Access tokens do not expire:** Intercom access tokens do not expire. Logically, Intercom doesn't return a refresh token along with the access token.

**Permissions are managed in the portal:** You do not need to pass API scopes/permissions during the authorization request. Permissions are only set in the Intercom Developer Portal when configuring your app.

**Rate limiting:** Intercom has [rate limits](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/references/rest-api/errors/rate-limiting) that vary by endpoint and plan type. Be mindful of these when building your integration.

**Region-specific instances:** For region-specific instances, you can configure the region during connection creation. Use `eu` for EU instances or `au` for Australia instances. If not specified, the default US region will be used.

For more details on Intercom's authentication implementation, see [Intercom's OAuth documentation](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/build-an-integration/learn-more/authentication/setting-up-oauth).
