This guide shows you how to obtain your OAuth credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) from Zapier so your users can grant your app access via the Workflow API.

## Prerequisites

Your app must be published as a **public integration** in [Zapier's App Directory](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/publish/public-integration#benefits-to-building-a-public-integration). You will only be able to configure redirect URIs and access Client ID / Client Secret after your app is public.

## Creating your Zapier OAuth app

<Steps>
   <Step title="Configure a redirect URI">
     In the [Zapier Developer Platform](https://developer.zapier.com/), go to **Embed → Settings → Redirect URIs** and add your Nango callback URL:

     **`https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`**

   </Step>

   <Step title="Get your Client ID and Client Secret">
     In the Zapier Developer Platform, go to **Embed → Settings → Credentials**. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

   </Step>

   <Step title="Determine required OAuth scopes">
     The Zapier Workflow API endpoints require different OAuth scopes. Check the [API reference](https://docs.zapier.com/partner-solutions/api-reference/) for each endpoint you use to see which scopes are required, and configure those scopes when setting up the integration in Nango.
   </Step>

   <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to connect your first account.
  </Step>
</Steps>
