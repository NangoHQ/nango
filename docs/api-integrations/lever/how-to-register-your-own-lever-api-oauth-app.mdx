This guide shows you how to register your own app with Lever to obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Lever account.

## Registering your OAuth application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to Lever">
    Go to your Lever account and navigate to the [Lever Settings](https://hire.lever.co/settings/integrations?tab=api) -> Integrations & API section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request OAuth credentials">
    Contact Lever to request OAuth credentials for your application. You'll need to provide:
    - **Application Name**: The name of your application
    - **Redirect URI**: Use `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
    - **Description**: Brief description of what your application does
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive OAuth credentials">
    After approval, Lever will provide you with:
    - **Client ID**: Your application's unique identifier
    - **Client Secret**: Your application's secret key

    Copy these credentials as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure in Nango">
    In your [Nango dashboard](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), go to the Lever integration and enter your Client ID and Client Secret.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Production vs Sandbox Environments

You should create different integrations in Nango for using the Lever production vs. sandbox API:

- **Lever (OAuth)** - For production use with the live Lever API
- **Lever (OAuth Sandbox)** - For testing with Lever's sandbox environment

Each environment requires separate OAuth credentials.

For more details on Lever's OAuth implementation, see [Lever's OAuth documentation](https://hire.lever.co/developer/oauth).
