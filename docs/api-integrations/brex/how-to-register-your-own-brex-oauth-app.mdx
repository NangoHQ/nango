This guide shows you how to register your own app with Brex to obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID and client secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Brex account.

<Note>
**This guide is for Brex developer partners only.** If you are a Brex client (i.e., you have your own Brex account), you can use the [API Key authentication](/api-integrations/brex-api-key) instead.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register as a Brex Partner">
    Go to [Brex Partners](https://www.brex.com/partners) and register as a Brex developer partner. This is required to access OAuth functionality.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your credentials">
    Contact the Brex developer support team to be issued a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for partner authentication. The scopes for your client and the Nango callback URL (`https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`) will be provided to you.
    
    Once your application is set up, you'll receive your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. You'll need these when configuring the integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to connect your first account.
  </Step>
</Steps>
