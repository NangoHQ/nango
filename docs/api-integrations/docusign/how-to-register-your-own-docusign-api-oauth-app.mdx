This guide shows you how to register your own app with DocuSign to obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their DocuSign account.

## Before you begin

To test your integration during development, use the `docusign-sandbox` configuration in Nango. This lets you test with the [DocuSign Developer account](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/account/).

## Registering your OAuth app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up for a developer account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [DocuSign Developer account](https://developers.docusign.com/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and configure an integration">
    1. Navigate to [Build Integration](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/build-integration/).
    2. Click **Create App & Get Keys** or similar button to start creating your integration.
    3. Fill in all the required information for your application.
    4. In the OAuth redirect URIs section, add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` as your redirect URL.
    5. Under the permission scopes section, select the various scopes you will need. See [DocuSign's OAuth scopes documentation](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/reference/scopes) for the full list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain OAuth credentials">
    On your app's configuration page, copy your **Integration Key** (this is your client ID) and **Secret Key** (this is your client secret).

    <Note>
    The DocuSign **Integration Key** is actually the 'client ID'. You'll also need to add a **Secret Key** when creating your app.
    </Note>

  </Step>
</Steps>
