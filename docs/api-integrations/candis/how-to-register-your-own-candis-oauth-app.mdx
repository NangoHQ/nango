This guide shows you how to register your own app with Candis to obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID and client secret). These are required so your users can grant your app access to their Candis account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Client ID and Client Secret">
    To receive your Client ID and Client Secret, contact the Candis team and include your Redirect URL as `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` in the message so they can whitelist it during setup.

    You can reach Candis via:
    - **Developer documentation chat** – Use the chat in the Candis developer documentation.
    - **Email** – Write to [support@candis.io](mailto:support@candis.io).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain your OAuth app credentials">
    Once your application is configured, you will receive both the client ID and client secret. Save them securely—you will need them when configuring the Candis integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>
