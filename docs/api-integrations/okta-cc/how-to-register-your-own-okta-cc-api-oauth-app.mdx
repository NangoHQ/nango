# Overview

To authenticate with Okta using Client Credentials, you need the following:
1. **Client ID** - A unique identifier for your Okta API Services application.
2. **Private Key (JWK)** - The RSA private key in JSON Web Key format, whose public key is registered in your Okta application.
3. **Okta Domain** - The subdomain of your Okta organization.
4. **Scopes** - A space-separated list of Okta Management API scopes (e.g. `okta.users.read okta.users.manage`).

This guide will walk you through creating an API Services application in Okta with `private_key_jwt` authentication.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an Okta account. Sign up for a free developer account at [developer.okta.com](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).


#### Step 1: Creating your Okta API Services application

1. Log in to your [Okta Admin Console](https://login.okta.com/).
2. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Applications** > **Applications**.
3. Click **Create App Integration**.
4. Select **API Services** as the sign-in method and click **Next**.
5. Give your application a name and click **Save**.
6. On the application's **General** tab, find your **Client ID** — you will need it in the final step.
7. Set Client authentication to Public key / Private key. `okta.*` scopes are only supported with this authentication method.
8. Disable Proof of possession (DPoP) as it's not supported by Nango

<Note>
The application must be created as **API Services**.

#### Step 2: Generating and registering your RSA key pair

Okta uses `private_key_jwt` for API Services apps. You generate an RSA key pair, register the **public** JWK with Okta, and provide the **private** JWK to Nango.

**Generate a private JWK** using the following Node.js script (requires Node.js 18+):

```javascript
const { generateKeyPairSync } = require('crypto');
const { privateKey, publicKey } = generateKeyPairSync('rsa', { modulusLength: 2048 });

const privateJwk = privateKey.export({ format: 'jwk' });
const publicJwk  = publicKey.export({ format: 'jwk' });

// Assign a kid — must match between private and public JWK
const kid = require('crypto').randomUUID();
privateJwk.kid = kid;
publicJwk.kid  = kid;

console.log('=== PUBLIC JWK (upload to Okta) ===');
console.log(JSON.stringify(publicJwk, null, 2));
console.log('\n=== PRIVATE JWK (paste into Nango) ===');
console.log(JSON.stringify(privateJwk));
```

**Register the public JWK in Okta:**

1. In the Admin Console, open your API Services application.
2. Go to the **General** tab and scroll to the **PUBLIC KEYS** section.
3. Click **Add Key**, paste the **public JWK JSON** output from the script above, and click **Save**.

<Note>
The private JWK is what you paste into Nango. It includes all key material (`d`, `p`, `q`, `dp`, `dq`, `qi`) and the `kid`. Keep it secret.
</Note>


#### Step 3: Finding your Okta Domain

Your Okta Domain is the subdomain of your Okta organization URL.

- In the Admin Console, your browser's address bar will show a URL like `https://dev-12345678-admin.okta.com`.
- Your **Okta Domain** is the part before `.okta.com`, ignoring `-admin` (e.g., `dev-12345678`).
- Alternatively, go to **Settings** > **Account** in the Admin Console to find your Okta domain.


#### Step 4: Grant API scopes to your application

Okta requires at least one scope in every token request. Before your application can request specific scopes, they must be granted:

1. In the Admin Console, navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and open your application.
2. Click the **Okta API Scopes** tab.
3. Grant the scopes your integration requires (e.g. `okta.users.read`, `okta.users.manage`).

A full list of available scopes is in the [Okta Management API reference](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/oauth2/#okta-admin-management).


#### Step 5: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Client ID**, **Private Key (JWK)**, **Okta Domain**, and **Scopes**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Okta (Client Credentials).
2. Enter your **Client ID**.
3. Paste your **Private Key (JWK)** — the full JSON object from the script above (single-line or formatted).
4. Enter your **Okta Domain** (e.g., `dev-12345678`).
5. Enter the **Scopes** as a space-separated list (e.g., `okta.users.read okta.users.manage`).
6. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.

You are now connected to Okta (Client Credentials).
