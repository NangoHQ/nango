This guide shows you how to create an **MCP auth app** in your HubSpot account and obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID and secret). These are required so your users can grant your app access to their HubSpot account via Nango.

## Create an MCP auth app in HubSpot

<Steps>
 <Step title="Create a developer account">
    If you don't have an account go to [HubSpot's developer signup page](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/developers) and create an account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open MCP Auth Apps">
    In your HubSpot account, go to **Development**. In the left sidebar, select **MCP Auth Apps**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new MCP auth app">
    In the upper right, click **Create MCP auth app**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your app details">
    In the dialog, fill in all your required information. For the **Redirect URL** add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and copy credentials">
    Click **Create**. After the app is created, copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. You will enter these when configuring the HubSpot (MCP) integration in Nango.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You're now ready to connect HubSpot MCP to Nango. For more on the HubSpot MCP server and OAuth, see [HubSpot's guide to integrating with the MCP server](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/apps/developer-platform/build-apps/integrate-with-the-remote-hubspot-mcp-server).
