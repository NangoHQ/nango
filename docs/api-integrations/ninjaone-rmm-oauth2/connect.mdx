# Overview

To connect your NinjaOne RMM account via OAuth2 Authorization Code flow, you'll need to create a **Web** OAuth application in NinjaOne and then authorize it through Nango.

### Prerequisites

- Admin access to your NinjaOne RMM tenant.

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Navigate to the API settings

1. Log in to your NinjaOne instance at `https://app.ninjarmm.com`.
2. Navigate to **Administration** > **Apps** > **API**.

3. Click on the **Client App IDs** tab.

#### Step 2: Create a Web OAuth application

1. Click the **Add** button to open the Application Configuration form.
2. Select **Web** as the Application Platform (this is critical — do **not** select "API Services / Machine-to-Machine").
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name for your application (e.g., "Nango Integration")
   - **Redirect URI**: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
   - **Allowed Grant Types**: Check both **Authorization Code** and **Refresh Token**
   - **Scopes/Permissions**: Select **Monitoring**, **Management**, and **Control** as needed
4. Click **Save** to create the application.

#### Step 3: Copy your credentials

1. After creating the application, the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be displayed.
2. **Important**: Copy and securely store both values immediately. The Client Secret is only shown once and cannot be retrieved later.

#### Step 4: Configure the integration in Nango

1. Open the Nango dashboard and navigate to **Integrations**.
2. Select or create the **NinjaOne RMM (OAuth2)** integration.
3. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the previous step.

#### Step 5: Authorize the connection

1. Go to **Connections** > **Add Test Connection**.
2. Click **Authorize** — you'll be redirected to NinjaOne's authorization page.
3. Sign in with your NinjaOne admin credentials and approve the requested permissions.
4. You'll be redirected back to Nango, and the connection will be active.

You are now connected to NinjaOne RMM using the OAuth2 Authorization Code flow.
