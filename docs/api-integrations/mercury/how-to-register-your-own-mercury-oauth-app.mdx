This guide shows you how to register your own app with Mercury to obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Mercury account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request OAuth access">
    1. Submit Mercury's [integration request form](https://mercurytechnologies.notion.site/2b1951a7f2158076b600db0ce173317c) with:
       - Your company name and website.
       - Company address.
       - A short description of your company.
       - Details about the product you plan to integrate with Mercury.
       - How you plan to use Mercury's API.
    2. Mercury will review your request. Approval timelines vary; they may ask for additional information. Approval depends on security, use case fit, and regulatory considerations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide technical setup (after approval)">
    When your integration is approved, provide Mercury with:
    - **Redirect URI:** `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
    - Links to your app's terms of service, privacy policy, and logo.
    - Your **GPG public key** so Mercury can securely send your client credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive credentials">
    Mercury will create your OAuth2 client and securely share:
    - **Client ID** and **Client secret**.
    - Credentials for a **test client** that can be used with Mercury [sandbox](https://docs.mercury.com/reference/using-mercury-sandbox).
    Save these; you will need them when configuring the Mercury integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>
