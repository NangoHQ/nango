This guide shows you how to register your own app with Microsoft Planner (via Microsoft Entra ID) to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Microsoft Planner account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Microsoft account and Azure account">
    If you don't already have them, sign up for a [Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/account) and an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID">
    1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an Application Developer.
    2. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the Settings icon in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application.
    3. From the search bar at the top of the Azure portal, search for **App registrations** and select it. Then choose **New registration**. Or from your left navigation tab, navigate to **Applications** > **App registrations** then choose **New registration**.
    4. Enter a meaningful name for your application, for example "Nango Integration".
    5. Under **Supported account types** you need to decide who can install your integration:
       - **Accounts in any organizational directory** - Any user account in a professional Microsoft organization (Business, School, etc.)
       - **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts** - The accounts from the first option, plus personal Microsoft accounts (pick this unless you want to restrict your integration to business accounts)
    6. Leave the **Redirect URI** section blank for now; we'll configure it in a later step.
    7. Click **Register** to complete the app registration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note your application (client) ID">
    After registration, you'll be taken to the application's Overview page. Record the **Application (client) ID**, which uniquely identifies your application and is used in your application's code as part of validating security tokens.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a redirect URI">
    1. In the left sidebar, select **Authentication**.
    2. Under **Platform configurations**, select **Add a platform**.
    3. Select **Web** as the platform type.
    4. Enter `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` as the Redirect URI.
    5. Under **Advanced settings**, keep **Allow public client flows** set to the default **No** for web applications.
    6. Click **Configure** to save your changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add API permissions">
    1. In the left sidebar, select **API permissions**.
    2. Click **Add a permission**.
    3. Select **Microsoft Graph** to integrate with **Microsoft Planner**.
    4. Select the required permissions from the **Delegated permissions section**.
    5. Select the specific permissions your app requires. Please refer to the table below for some of the [commonly used scopes](#common-scopes).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a client secret">
    1. In the left sidebar, select **Certificates & secrets**.
    2. Under **Client secrets**, select **New client secret**.
    3. Enter a description and choose an expiry period.
    4. Click **Add** and record the value of the client secret immediately (it will not be shown again).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure credentials in Nango">
    1. In the [Nango dashboard](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), select your Microsoft Planner integration.
    2. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** you obtained from Azure.
    3. Save your changes.
  </Step>
