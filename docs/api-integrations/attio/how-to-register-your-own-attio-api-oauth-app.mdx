This guide shows you how to register your own app with Attio to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Attio account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Attio Developer account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for an [Attio Developer account](https://build.attio.com/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new app">
    1. Log in to your [Attio Developer account](https://build.attio.com/auth/login).
    2. From the left sidebar, click **+ New app** and enter a unique **name** for your app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OAuth settings">
    1. On your app's settings page, open the **OAuth** tab.
    2. Toggle **OAuth** on, and add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` as your **Redirect URIs**.
    3. Configure the appropriate [scopes](https://docs.attio.com/rest-api/how-to/authentication#scopes) your integration needs.
    4. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, you'll need these when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish your app">
    1. Navigate to the **App listing** tab and complete all the required fields.
    2. Click the **Publish app** button in the top-right corner. Attio's team will review your submission (typically within 48 hours). Once approved, your app will become **Public** and available to other users.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>Attio's API uses object-based endpoints where you specify the object type (e.g., people, companies) in the URL path.</Note>
