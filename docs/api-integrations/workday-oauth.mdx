## 🚀 Quickstart

Connect to Workday with Nango and see data flow in 2 minutes.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an integration">
        In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Workday (OAuth)_.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Authorize Workday">
        Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Workday. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
    </Step>
      <Step title="Call the Workday API">
        Let's make your first request to the Workday API (fetch worker information). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="cURL">

                ```bash
                curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/v1/{connectionConfig.tenant}/workers" \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
                  -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
                  -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
                ```

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Node">

            Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:


            ```typescript
            import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

            const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });
            const connectionId = '<CONNECTION-ID>';
            const providerConfigKey = '<INTEGRATION-ID>';
            const connection = await nango.getConnection(providerConfigKey, connectionId);

            const res = await nango.get({
                endpoint: `/v1/${connection.connection_config['tenant']}/workers`,
                providerConfigKey,
                connectionId
            });

            console.log(JSON.stringify(res.data, null, 2));
            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

        <Note>
        The `{connectionConfig.tenant}` in the URL represents the `tenant`. You can get this value from your connection configuration after creating the connection.
        </Note>
      </Step>

    <Step title="Implement Nango in your app">
        Follow our [Auth implementation guide](/implementation-guides/platform/auth/implement-api-auth) to integrate Nango in your app.

        To obtain your own production credentials, follow the setup guide linked below.
    </Step>
</Steps>

✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.

<Tip>
Next step: [Embed the auth flow](/implementation-guides/platform/auth/implement-api-auth) in your app to let your users connect their Workday accounts.

## 🚨 API Gotchas

- Workday provides two APIs, a REST and a SOAP one and Nango supports them both.
- Access to most of Workday's API doc resources, including detailed documentation on OAuth authentication flows, is typically restricted to Workday customers and partners. To access these resources, you can:
  1. **Sign In to Workday Community**: Visit the [Workday Community](https://community.workday.com/) and sign in with your Workday credentials. If you don't have an account, you can [request one](https://workday.my.site.com/customercenter/register).
  2. **Contact Workday Support**: If you are a customer, reach out to Workday Support for assistance in accessing specific documentation.
