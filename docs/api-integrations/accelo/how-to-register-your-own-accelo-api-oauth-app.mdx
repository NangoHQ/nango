This guide shows you how to register your own app with Accelo to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Accelo account.

## Registering your application

To use Accelo's API with OAuth 2.0, you need to register your application with Accelo.

Follow Accelo's official guide to register your application: [How to register an Application](https://api.accelo.com/docs/#registering-your-application)

## Connection configuration in Nango

Accelo [requires a user specific subdomain](https://api.accelo.com/docs/#oauth2-0-uri) to run OAuth. When creating connections in Nango, your users will need to provide their Accelo subdomain.

The subdomain is the first part of your Accelo URL. For example, if your Accelo account is at `https://mycompany.api.accelo.com`, your subdomain is `mycompany`.

## OAuth scopes

When configuring your OAuth app, you'll need to specify which scopes your app requires. Scopes define what data and actions your app can access in a user's Accelo account.

For a complete list of available OAuth scopes, see [Accelo's scope documentation](https://api.accelo.com/docs/#scope).
