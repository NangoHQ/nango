This guide shows you how to register your own OAuth application with Fanvue to obtain your OAuth credentials (Client ID & Client Secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Fanvue account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Fanvue Account">
    If you don't already have one, go to the [Fanvue](https://www.fanvue.com/) and create an account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new OAuth application">
    1. Navigate to the [developer portal](https://www.fanvue.com/developers/apps) and click **Create App**.
    2. Enter a name for your application, accept the terms, and click the **Create** button.
    3. Your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be generated. **Note these down** as you will need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
    4. Select the application you have just created and navigate to the **OAuth** tab.
    5. In the **Redirects** section, add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
    6. Select the scopes your app will need and copy them, as you will also need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to start building your integration.
  </Step>
</Steps>
