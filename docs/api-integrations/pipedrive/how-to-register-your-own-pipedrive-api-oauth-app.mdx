This guide shows you how to register your own app with Pipedrive to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Pipedrive account.

## Creating a Pipedrive OAuth app

<Steps>
   <Step title="Access the Pipedrive Marketplace">
     Log in to your Pipedrive account and navigate to the [Pipedrive Marketplace Developer Hub](https://developers.pipedrive.com/).
   </Step>

   <Step title="Create a new app">
     Click on "Create an app" or "New app" to start the registration process.
   </Step>

   <Step title="Configure your app settings">
     Fill in the required information for your app:
     - **App name**: Choose a name for your application
     - **Description**: Provide a brief description of what your app does
     - **OAuth & Access scopes**: Select the scopes your application needs
   </Step>

   <Step title="Set up OAuth redirect URI">
     In the OAuth settings, add your Nango OAuth redirect URI:

     ```
     https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback
     ```

     For local development, you may also need to add:

     ```
     http://localhost:3003/oauth/callback
     ```
   </Step>

   <Step title="Save and obtain credentials">
     After saving your app configuration, Pipedrive will generate:
     - **Client ID**: Your OAuth client identifier
     - **Client Secret**: Your OAuth client secret

     Copy these credentials - you'll need them to configure your integration in Nango.
   </Step>

   <Step title="Configure the integration in Nango">
     In the Nango dashboard:
     1. Go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations)
     2. Find and select Pipedrive
     3. Enter your Client ID and Client Secret
     4. Save the configuration
   </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
After creating your OAuth app, you may need to submit it for review before it can be used by users outside your organization. Check Pipedrive's [OAuth documentation](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-oauth-api) for details on the app review process.
</Note>

## Understanding Pipedrive scopes

Pipedrive uses OAuth scopes to control what data your application can access. When configuring your app, select only the scopes necessary for your use case.

For a complete list of available scopes and their permissions, see [Pipedrive's scopes documentation](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-scopes-and-permissions-explanations#list-of-scopes).

## Connection configuration

Pipedrive requires an `api_domain` parameter that is returned during the OAuth flow. Nango automatically extracts and stores this value from the token response, so you don't need to configure it manually.

When making API calls through Nango's proxy, the correct API domain will be used automatically based on the connection.

For more information on Pipedrive's OAuth implementation and API concepts, see [Pipedrive's API documentation](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/core-api-concepts-about-pipedrive-api).
