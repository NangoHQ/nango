This guide shows you how to register your own app with Google Cloud to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Google Sheets account.

<Info>
  You will need to pass a Google review to go live with your integration.

  [Follow our guide](/integrations/google-security-review) to get approved as fast as possible.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Google Cloud account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new project">
    1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    2. Click on the project dropdown at the top left of the page.
    3. Click **New Project**.
    4. Enter a **Project Name** for your project.
    5. Under **Location**, select the appropriate organization or folder where this project should belong.
    <Note>If you're not part of an organization, it will default to No organization</Note>
    6. Click **Create** and wait for the project to be created.
    7. Select it from the project dropdown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable the APIs you need">
    1. Go to the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) in the Google Cloud Console.
    2. Search for **Google Sheets API** and select it, then click **Enable**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the OAuth consent screen">
    1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen** in the Google Cloud Console.
    2. Click **Get started**.
    3. Fill in all the required fields in the **App Information** form.
    4. Click **Next**. Select the appropriate Audience:
       - **External**: For applications available to any Google user
       - **Internal**: For applications restricted to users within your Google Workspace organization
    5. Click **Next**. Fill in the **Contact Information**; these are the email addresses that Google will use to notify you about any changes to your project.
    6. Click **Next**, then check the **I agree to the Google API Services: User Data Policy** checkbox, and click **Continue**.
    7. Add the scopes your application needs. Under **Data Access**, click **Add or Remove Scopes** and select the scopes that correspond to the APIs you enabled.
    8. Under **Audience**, click **Add users** if you selected **External** user type (required for testing before verification).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create OAuth 2.0 credentials">
    1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** in the Google Cloud Console.
    2. Click **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
    3. Select **Web application** as the application type.
    4. Enter a name for your OAuth client.
    5. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
    6. Click **Create**.
    7. A dialog will appear with your client ID and client secret. Save these credentials securely as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start building your integration">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to build your integration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify your app">
    Most GSheet scopes are marked "sensitive" by Google. You need to pass a Google review to go live.

   [Follow our guide](/integrations/google-security-review) to prepare and pass as quickly as possible.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish your app (switch from Testing to Production)">
    To move your OAuth app from testing to production:
    1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen** > **Audience**.
    2. Click **Publish App** to switch your app from testing to production.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Important Notes

When configuring your OAuth app, make sure to:
- Select scopes from the scopes page based on the APIs you enabled earlier when setting up the app
- Set the _Authorized JavaScript origins_ to your site URL (`https://app.nango.dev` if you're testing from the Nango UI)

## Common Scopes

Refer to [Google's OAuth 2.0 Scopes](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) for the full list of available scopes. Common scopes for Google Sheets include:

- `openid` - Access to basic profile information
- `profile` - Access to user's basic profile information
- `email` - Access to user's email address
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` - See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Sheets spreadsheets
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly` - See all your Google Sheets spreadsheets

## API Gotchas

Be aware of these Google OAuth implementation details:

- **Refresh token expiration:** Under certain circumstances, Google expires a user's refresh token. This can happen when:
  - The user has [revoked your app's access](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3466521#remove-access)
  - The user changed passwords and the refresh token contains Gmail scopes
  - The user account has exceeded the maximum number of granted (live) refresh tokens
  - The user granted [time-based access](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#time-based-access) and it expired
  - An admin [set services in your app's scopes to Restricted](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227#restrictaccess)
  - For [Google Cloud Platform APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#gcp), the session length set by the admin was exceeded
  - **Testing mode limitation:** In "Testing" mode with an external user type, refresh tokens expire in 7 days unless only basic scopes are used (userinfo.email, userinfo.profile, openid, or their [OpenID Connect equivalents](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#openid-connect)). Switch from Testing to Production to remove this limitation.
  - **Token limit:** Google allows up to 100 refresh tokens per account per OAuth client ID; new tokens overwrite the oldest without warning when the limit is reached

- **Verification requirements:** For applications using sensitive or restricted scopes, Google requires verification and a security assessment. This process can take several weeks to complete.

- **User types:** Google's OAuth consent screen has different configurations for "External" and "Internal" user types. Internal is only available for Google Workspace users and limits access to users within your organization.

- **Incremental authorization:** Google implements incremental authorization, allowing you to request additional scopes over time without requiring users to re-authorize all previously granted scopes.

- **Rate limits:** Google enforces [rate limits](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reports/v1/limits) on API requests, which vary depending on the specific API being used.

For more details, see the [Google OAuth 2.0 documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) and [Google Sheets API documentation](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest).
