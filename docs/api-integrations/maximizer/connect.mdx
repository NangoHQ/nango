# Overview

To connect **Maximizer (Cloud)** with Nango, you need:

1. **Region** – The region-specific subdomain.
2. **Company Alias** – The alias of your Maximizer cloud account.

Both are visible in the URL you use to log in to Maximizer. This guide shows how to extract them.

## Prerequisites

- A Maximizer cloud account.

## Step 1: Find your Region and Company Alias

The URL you use to log in to Maximizer (Cloud) has the form:

`https://{region}.maximizercrmlive.com/{company_alias}`

- **Region** – The subdomain before `maximizercrmlive.com` (e.g. `caw`, `ukw`).
- **Company Alias** – The path segment after the host (your account alias).

**Example:** If your client login URL is `https://caw.maximizercrmlive.com/acme`, then:
- **Region** = `caw`
- **Company Alias** = `acme`

#### Step 2: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

1. Open the form where you connect to Maximizer (Cloud)
2. Enter your **Region** and **Company Alias** in their respective fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
