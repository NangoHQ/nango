This guide shows you how to register your own app with Airtable to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Airtable account.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an Airtable account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for an [Airtable account](https://airtable.com/signup).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Register a new OAuth integration">
    1. Go to the [OAuth integrations panel](https://airtable.com/create/oauth) in your Airtable account.
    2. Click **Register new OAuth integration**.
    3. Enter a unique name for your integration.
    4. Add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` as your OAuth redirect URI.
    5. Click **Register integration**.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure OAuth scopes and details">
    1. Select the [scopes](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/scopes) your application requires.
    2. Add optional details like tagline, homepage URL, and logo.
    3. For public integrations, add required fields: support email, privacy policy URL, and terms of service URL.
    4. Click **Save changes**.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Generate credentials">
    1. Click **Generate client secret** and confirm the action.
    2. Copy the **Client Secret** (you'll only see it once).
    3. Note your **Client ID** from the integration management page.
    4. You'll need both when configuring your integration in Nango.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Scopes

| Scope | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `data.records:read` | Read records from bases. |
| `data.records:write` | Create, update, and delete records. |
| `schema.bases:read` | Read base schema (table/field names and types). |
| `data.recordComments:read` | Read comments on records. |
| `data.recordComments:write` | Create and delete record comments. |
| `user.email:read` | Read the email of the authenticated user. |
| `workspacesAndBases:read` | List the user's workspaces and bases to select from. |

<Note>
During the OAuth flow, users can decide which resources (Bases) your app should have access to. This means your app might not have access to all bases in their workspace.
</Note>

<Note>
Airtable requires specific scopes for different operations. Make sure to request all necessary scopes during OAuth setup.
