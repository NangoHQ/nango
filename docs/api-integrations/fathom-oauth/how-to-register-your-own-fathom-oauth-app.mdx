This guide shows you how to register your own app with Fathom to obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Fathom account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Fathom account">
    If you don't have a Fathom account, sign up for a free account at [fathom.ai](https://www.fathom.ai/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register your application">
    1. Navigate to the [create app form](https://fathom.video/marketplace_applications/new).
    2. Fill in all the required details for your application.
    3. For the **Redirect URLs** field, add: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
    4. Submit the form to create your application.
    5. After creation, note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for both production and development environments. You'll need these when configuring the integration in Nango.
    
    <Note>Currently, the only available OAuth scope is `public_api`.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to connect your first account.
  </Step>
</Steps>
