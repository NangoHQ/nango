This guide shows you how to register your own app with Canvas LMS to obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID and client secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Canvas LMS account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Developer Keys and create API Key">
    1. Log in to your Canvas LMS instance as an administrator.
    2. In Global Navigation, click **Admin**, then click the name of your account.
    3. In Account Navigation, click **Developer Keys**.
    4. Click the **Add Developer Key** button and select the **API Key** option.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter API Key Settings">
    Fill in all the required settings for your OAuth API key:
    For the **Redirect URIs**: Add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Developer Key">
    Click the **Save** button to create your developer key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your credentials">
    After saving, you'll see your developer key in the list. Ensure that the key is enabled, then:
    1. **Client ID**: The **Client ID** is displayed in the developer key **Details** column.
    2. **Client Secret**: Click the **Show Key** button to view your **Client Secret**.
    3. Save both the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** - you'll need these when configuring the integration in Nango.
  </Step>
   <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>
