This guide shows you how to register your own app with Justworks to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Justworks account.

<Note>Creation of OAuth Applications for the Justworks API is not self-service. You'll need to contact the Justworks team to set one up.</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request OAuth application">
    To obtain access to the API, contact [partner-api@justworks.com](mailto:partner-api@justworks.com) to request an OAuth application.
    
    Provide the following required information:
    - **Name**: How you want your app identified to your customers (most likely your company/product name)
    - **Redirect URI**: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
    - **Scopes**: The set of data your application needs access to. See the [available Scopes](https://public-api.justworks.com/v1/docs#section/OAuth-Scopes)
    
    <Tip>You can optionally provide a Logo URL, Terms of Service URL, and Privacy Policy URL, which will be shown to customers when they authorize your application.</Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive your credentials">
    Once your OAuth application is created, Justworks will provide you with:
    - **Client ID**
    - **Client Secret**

   You’ll need these credentials when configuring the integration in Nango. Pass them along with the various scopes you previously requested.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to connect your first account.
  </Step>
</Steps>
