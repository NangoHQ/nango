# Overview

To authenticate with ModMed, you will need:
1. **Environment** - The environment you're connecting to (sandbox or production)
2. **Firm URL Prefix** - The firm URL prefix for your practice
3. **Username** - Your ModMed API username
4. **Password** - Your ModMed API password
5. **API Key** - Your ModMed API key

This guide will walk you through finding these credentials within ModMed.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a ModMed account with API access.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Request access to ModMed sandbox

1. Request access to the ModMed sandbox by visiting [https://www.modmed.com/become-a-partner/](https://www.modmed.com/become-a-partner/) and submitting the partner request form.
2. Once approved, ModMed will provide you with:
   - **Username**: Your ModMed API username
   - **Password**: Your ModMed API password
   - **API Key**: Your ModMed API key

<Note>
To use a production key, you must complete a review process with ModMed. Once the demo and technical discussion are successfully completed and your desired resources are provisioned, you will receive a production key and instructions on how to take practices live with your application. For more details, see the [ModMed documentation on requesting resources](https://portal.api.modmed.com/reference/development-basics#requesting-resources).

#### Step 2: Finding your Firm URL Prefix

The **Firm URL Prefix** is the practice unique identifier for the specific firm (practice) you'll be working with.

#### Step 3: Selecting your Environment

Choose the appropriate environment based on your needs. Use the following table to select the correct environment value:

| Environment Name | Value |
| - | - |
| Generic Sandboxes | `stage.ema-api.com/ema-dev` |
| Practice Sandboxes | `stage.ema-api.com/ema-training` |
| Production | `mmapi.ema-api.com/ema-prod` |

#### Step 4: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your ModMed credentials:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with ModMed.
2. Enter your **Environment**, **Firm URL Prefix**, **Username**, **Password**, and **API Key** in their designated fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
