6. Select **Access this Product** to view available subscription plans for the selected API product.

   **Subscription Plans:**
   - **Demo Plan**: A sandbox environment used to test communication with Availity APIs. Demo subscriptions are automatically approved and recommended for initial testing.
   - **Standard Plan**: Full access to REST APIs and production data. Requires contract approval from the Trading Partner Management team.

   <Note>It's recommended that you start with a Demo subscription to gain knowledge of the Availity REST API workflow. After exploring the Demo Plan, if you're ready to move forward, first place your subscription request for the Standard Plan on the Developer Portal, then email partnermanagement@availity.com.</Note>
