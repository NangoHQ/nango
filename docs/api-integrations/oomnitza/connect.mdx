# Overview

To authenticate with Oomnitza, you will need:
1. **Subdomain** - The subdomain of your Oomnitza instance (e.g., `mycompany` for `mycompany.oomnitza.com`).
2. **API Token** - A key that grants Nango permission to interact with Oomnitza's API resources and services.

This guide will walk you through finding your **Subdomain** and generating your **API Token** within Oomnitza.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an Oomnitza account with API access

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding your Subdomain

Your Oomnitza subdomain is the part of your Oomnitza URL that appears before `.oomnitza.com`. 

For example, if your Oomnitza URL is `https://mycompany.oomnitza.com`, your subdomain is `mycompany`.

You can find your subdomain by checking the URL in your browser when you're logged into Oomnitza.

#### Step 2: Generating your API Token

1. Log in to your **Oomnitza** account.
2. Navigate to **Configuration** > **Security** > **API tokens**.
3. Click **+** to add a new token.
4. Enter a name for the token.
5. Enter the name of the user to whom the token will be assigned and click **SUBMIT**. 

Your API token will be generated. Copy it immediately, as you'll need it for authentication.

#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Subdomain** and **API Token**:

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Oomnitza.
2. Enter your **Subdomain** and **API Token** in their respective fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
