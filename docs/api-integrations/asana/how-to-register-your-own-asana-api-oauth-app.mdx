This guide shows you how to register your own app with Asana to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Asana account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a free trial [Asana account](https://asana.com/create-account).
  </Step>
   <Step title="Create & configure an Asana app">
     1. Navigate to [My apps](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps).
     2. Click the **Create new app** button.
     3. Fill in all the required information and click **Create app**.
     4. You will be redirected to your app's settings. Navigate to the **OAuth** tab and click **+ Add redirect URL**. Add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` as your redirect URL.
     5. Under the **Permission scopes** section, select the various scopes you will need.
   </Step>
   <Step title="Change the distribution">
    1. Navigate to the **Manage distribution** tab and select **Any workspace**.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Obtain OAuth credentials">
    1. Under the same **OAuth** tab, copy your **Client ID** and **Client secret** as you will need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
    </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If you are getting `The required parameter client_id is missing or invalid`, you will most likely need to go to [Developer Console](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps) -> Your app -> Manage distribution -> Change from `Specific workspaces` to `Any workspace`.
</Note>
