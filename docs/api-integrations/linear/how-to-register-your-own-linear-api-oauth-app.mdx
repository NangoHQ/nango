This guide shows you how to register your own app with Linear to obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Linear account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Linear account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Linear account](https://linear.app/signup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an OAuth2 application">
    1. Log in to your [Linear account](https://linear.app/login).
    2. Under your specific workspace, navigate to **Settings** > **API** > **OAuth applications**.
    3. Click the **+** icon.
    <Note> It is highly recommended to create a dedicated workspace for managing your OAuth application, as each admin user will have access. </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth application">
    1. Fill in all the required information. For **Callback URLs**, add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` and toggle the **Public** switch to allow installation in other workspaces. Newly created OAuth applications will have the **Refresh Tokens** option enabled by default. If it is not enabled, you can turn it on to allow new connections to include refresh token functionality.
    2. Click **Create** to save your application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain OAuth credentials">
    1. After creating your application, you'll be provided with **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Make a copy of these credentials as they will be needed when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>Linear is moving to short-lived OAuth2 access tokens with refresh tokens starting `Oct 1, 2025`. Existing OAuth2 apps must be updated to support refresh tokens by toggling the **Refresh Token** option in the OAuth settings. Connections created before enabling this will still have the 10-year expiry; only new connections after enabling will include refresh tokens in the response.</Note>
