# Overview

To authenticate with Cloudflare, you will need:
1. **API Token** - A key that grants Nango permission to interact with Cloudflare's API resources and services.

This guide will walk you through generating your **API Token** within Cloudflare.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a Cloudflare account

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Generating your API Token

Cloudflare API Tokens can be created for individual users or accounts.

Cloudflare [recommends](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) using Account API Tokens if you prefer credentials that are not associated with users.

To create an Account API Token:

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login)
2. Navigate to **Manage Account** > **Account API Tokens** in the left sidebar menu.
3. Click **Create Token** to create your API Token.

#### Step 2: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **API Token**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Cloudflare.
2. Enter your **API Token** in the respective field.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
