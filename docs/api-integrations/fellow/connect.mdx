# Overview

To authenticate with Fellow, you will need:
1. **Workspace Subdomain** - The subdomain of your Fellow workspace.
2. **API Key** - A key that grants secure access to the API, enabling authorized applications to interact with Fellow resources and services.

This guide will walk you through finding your **Workspace Subdomain** and generating your **API Key** within Fellow.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a Fellow account
- Workspace admin access may be required to enable the Developer API

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding your Workspace Subdomain

1. Log in to your [Fellow workspace](https://fellow.app/auth/login/)
2. Once logged in, check the URL in your browser's address bar
3. Your workspace subdomain is the part of the URL before `.fellow.app`. For example, if your workspace URL is `https://myworkspace.fellow.app`, your subdomain is `myworkspace`.

#### Step 2: Enabling the Developer API and Generating Your API Key
