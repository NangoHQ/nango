This guide shows you how to register your own app with Greenhouse to obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID and client secret) for the Greenhouse Harvest V3 API. These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Greenhouse account.

<Note>
You must have a signed Greenhouse partnership agreement before you can create an OAuth app. If you haven't done so already, please fill out the [integration request form](https://www.greenhouse.io/partners) to begin the process.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your client credentials">
    1. Contact Greenhouse Partner Support via [partner-support@greenhouse.io](mailto:partner-support@greenhouse.io).
    2. Provide the following information:
       - **Integration Name**: What is your product/integration called?
       - **Environment**: Is this for testing (only your own sandbox) or production (live for mutual customers)?
       - **Required Scopes**: Which specific data permissions does your integration need (e.g., `harvest:job_posts:list`, `harvest:candidates:list`)? See [Harvest API documentation](https://developers.greenhouse.io/harvest.html) per endpoint for available scopes.
       - **Redirect URI**: The URL where you handle the authorization code callback: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
       - **Logo**: Provide a 128x128 logo file. Customers will see this when authorizing your integration.
    3. Greenhouse will provide you with a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Keep your Client Secret confidential and you will also need these when configuring your integration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to connect your first account.
  </Step>
