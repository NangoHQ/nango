## 🚀 Quickstart

Connect to Jira with Nango and see data flow in 2 minutes.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create the integration">
    In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Jira_.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Authorize Jira">
    Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Jira. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Call the Jira API">
    Let's make your first request to the Jira API (fetch a list of issues). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
    <Tabs>
        <Tab title="cURL">
            ```bash
            curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/ex/jira/{connectionConfig.cloudId}/rest/api/3/search?maxResults=10" \
              -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
              -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
              -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
            ```
        </Tab>

        <Tab title="Node">

        Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

        ```typescript
        import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

        const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

        const res = await nango.get({
            endpoint: '/ex/jira/{connectionConfig.cloudId}/rest/api/3/search',
            params: {
              maxResults: 10
            },
            providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
            connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
        });

        console.log(JSON.stringify(res.data, null, 2));
        ```
        </Tab>

    </Tabs>

    Or fetch credentials with the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

    <Note>
    The `{connectionConfig.cloudId}` in the URL represents the cloudId. You can get this value from your connection configuration after creating the connection. The cloudId is automatically set by Nango.
    </Note>

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Implement Nango in your app">
        Follow our [quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart/embed-in-your-app) to integrate Nango in your app.

        To obtain your own production credentials, follow the setup guide linked below.
