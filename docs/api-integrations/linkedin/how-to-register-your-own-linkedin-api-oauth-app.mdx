This guide shows you how to register your own app with LinkedIn to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their LinkedIn account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a developer account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a free [LinkedIn's developer account](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create & configure a LinkedIn app">
    1. Go to the [Create an app](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps/new) page
    2. Fill in all the required details, then click the **Create App** button.
    3. In the **Products** tab, select the products you need for your integration. This will automatically add the necessary OAuth 2.0 scopes in the **Auth** tab.
    4. In the **Auth** tab, configure the following Redirect URL: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`, then copy both the **Client ID** and **Primary Client Secret**, you will need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Important considerations

**Scope permissions and re-authentication**

If the scope permissions are changed in your app, your users must re-authenticate to ensure that they have explicitly granted your application all of the permissions that it is requesting on their behalf.

**Product access determines available scopes**

The scopes available to your app depend on which Products or Partner Programs your app has access to.

**Refresh tokens and app verification**

In order to receive refresh tokens for your connections you must request the **Advertising API** product in your app under the **Products** tab on LinkedIn. This also requires your app to be verified which can be done by your LinkedIn page admin.

For more details on LinkedIn's OAuth implementation, see [LinkedIn's authorization documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow?context=linkedin%2Fcontext&tabs=HTTPS1).
