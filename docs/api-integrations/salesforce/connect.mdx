<Note>The hostname is optional. If not provided, Nango will use the default Salesforce login endpoint (`login.salesforce.com`). Providing a hostname ensures you connect to your specific Salesforce instance.</Note>

#### Step 2: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Hostname** (optional):
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Salesforce.
2. Enter your **Hostname** in the respective field.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
