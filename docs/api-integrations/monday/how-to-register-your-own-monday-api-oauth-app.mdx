This guide shows you how to register your own app with Monday to obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Monday account.

## Registering your Monday OAuth app

<Steps>
    <Step title="Access the Monday Developers section">
        Log in to your Monday account.
        Click on the profile icon in the top right corner and select _Developers_.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create an OAuth application">
        On the _Developers_ section, click on the _Create App_ button.
        Select the newly created app from the list.
        Scroll down to the _App Credentials_ section.
        Copy the _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_.
        You will need them when configuring Nango.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure the redirect URL">
        On the created app page, select the _Build_ dropdown at the right side of the page.
        Select _OAuth and Permissions_
        At the top of the page, select the _Redirect URLs_ tab.
        Add the following Redirect URL: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
        Click on _Save Scopes_.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Promote the Monday app to live">
        At the top right of the page, click on the _Promote to Live_ button.
        Click on the confirmation button.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Next">
        Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to set up your Monday integration in Nango.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Important API Considerations

**Access tokens do not expire:** Access tokens will be valid until the user uninstalls your app. Monday's OAuth flow does not support refresh tokens at the moment.

For more details on Monday's OAuth implementation, see [Monday's OAuth documentation](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/oauth).
