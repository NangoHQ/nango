This guide shows you how to generate an API token in Perdoo and connect it to Nango.

## Prerequisites

- An active Perdoo account
- Access to Personal Settings in Perdoo

## Generating Your API Token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Personal Settings">
    1. Log in to your Perdoo account at [https://eu.perdoo.com](https://eu.perdoo.com)
    2. Click on your profile icon in the top right corner
    3. Select **Personal Settings** from the dropdown menu
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to API Tokens">
    In the left sidebar, click on **API Tokens**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate a New Token">
    1. Click **Generate New Token** or **Create API Token**
    2. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "Nango Integration")
    3. Copy the generated token immediately - it won't be shown again
    
    <Warning>
    Store your API token securely. The token is a 64-character hexadecimal string (e.g., `5037c64a83d34725a13131b9b28856c0e499887b16c84b6d9bba2756d1e61634`). Perdoo will not show it again after creation.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Token to Nango">
    1. In your Nango dashboard, navigate to **Connections**
    2. Click **Add Test Connection**
    3. Select **Perdoo** from the integration list
    4. Paste your API token in the **API Token** field
    5. Click **Connect** to complete the setup
    
    Nango will automatically verify your credentials by making a test request to the Perdoo API.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing the Connection

Once connected, Nango verifies your token by making a request to:
```
GET https://eu.perdoo.com/user
```

If successful, you'll see a confirmation that your Perdoo integration is active.

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Token Error

**Possible causes:**
- The token wasn't copied completely (ensure all 64 characters are included)
- The token has been revoked in Perdoo's Personal Settings
- The token doesn't have appropriate permissions

**Solution:** Generate a new token in Perdoo and ensure you copy the entire 64-character value.

### Connection Failed

**Possible causes:**
- Incorrect Perdoo instance region (verify you're using the EU region)
- Perdoo account is inactive or suspended
- API access is disabled for your organization

**Solution:** Verify your account status and confirm API access is enabled.

### API Request Errors

**Possible causes:**
- The API token has expired or been revoked
- Network connectivity issues
- Perdoo API service disruption

**Solution:** Check the [Perdoo status page](https://status.perdoo.com) and verify your token is still valid.
