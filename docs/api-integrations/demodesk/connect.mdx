# Overview

To authenticate with DemoDesk, you will need:
1. **API Key** - A key that grants secure access to the DemoDesk API. The type of API key you need depends on your intended level of access.

This guide will walk you through determining which API key you need and how to obtain it.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a DemoDesk account

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Obtaining your API key

1. Determine which API key you need: **MASTER_3RD_PARTY_API_KEY** for partnership-level actions, **COMPANY_ADMIN_USER_API_KEY** for company-level administration, or **USER_API_KEY** for individual user-level access.
    - If you need a **MASTER_3RD_PARTY_API_KEY**, refer to your partnership agreement with DemoDesk or contact your DemoDesk partnership manager.
    - If you need a **COMPANY_ADMIN_USER_API_KEY**, create or access your company account in DemoDesk. The key will be provided in the response when the account is created or can be accessed in your company admin settings.
    - If you need a **USER_API_KEY**, add or access a user in your company account. The key will be provided in the response when the user is created or can be accessed in the user management section.

#### Step 2: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **API Key**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with DemoDesk.
2. Enter your **API Key** (MASTER_3RD_PARTY_API_KEY, COMPANY_ADMIN_USER_API_KEY, or USER_API_KEY) in the respective field.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
