This guide shows you how to register your own app with Amazon to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Amazon account.

## Register your application

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an Amazon developer account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for an [Amazon Developer account](https://developer.amazon.com/).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Register your application">
    Go to the [Login with Amazon console](https://developer.amazon.com/loginwithamazon/console/site/lwa/overview.html) and click **Register new application**.

    Enter your application name and description, then save the application.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure OAuth settings">
    In your application settings:

    1. Click **Web Settings** under the application name
    2. Click **Edit** to configure the OAuth settings
    3. Add your **Allowed JavaScript Origins** (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
    4. Add your **Allowed Return URLs** - this should be your Nango callback URL:
       ```
       https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback
       ```
       Or if you're self-hosting Nango, use your instance's callback URL.
    5. Save your changes
    </Step>

    <Step title="Get your OAuth credentials">
    After saving, you'll see your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in the web settings section. Copy these credentials.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add credentials to Nango">
    In the [Nango dashboard](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), find your Amazon integration and add:
    - **Client ID** from step 4
    - **Client Secret** from step 4
    - **Scopes** - Add the required scopes for your use case (see [Amazon's scope documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/customer-profile.html))
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Connection configuration in Nango

Amazon uses different domain extensions for different regions (e.g., `amazon.com` for the US, `amazon.co.uk` for the UK, or `amazon.de` for Germany). When creating a connection in Nango, you can specify the region-specific domain using connection configuration parameters.

For more details on Amazon's OAuth implementation, see [Amazon's OAuth documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/authorization-code-grant.html).
