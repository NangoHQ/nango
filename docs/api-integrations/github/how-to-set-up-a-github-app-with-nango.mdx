This guide covers how to set up a GitHub App with Nango. GitHub Apps provide more fine-grained permissions and better control over API access compared to OAuth Apps. Nango supports three GitHub App authentication methods: `github-app`, `github-app-oauth`, and standard `github` OAuth Apps.

<Note>
There are certain API methods that only work with an OAuth App that will not work with a GitHub App. Please check the GitHub documentation and look for a "Works with GitHub Apps" header under the endpoint.

## Understanding GitHub App authentication methods

### github-app (Installation-based)

When setting up a GitHub App with the `github-app` auth mode in Nango:

- **App ID**: Made of numbers (e.g. 401953)
- **App Public Link**: The URL to your GitHub App public page (e.g. https://github.com/apps/nango-github-app)
- **App Private Key**: Needs to be generated in your GitHub App settings and starts with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` (not to be confused with the Client Secrets)
- **Setup URL**: The Setup URL displayed on your Nango integration page needs to be added to your GitHub App configuration (not to be confused with the Callback URL that can stay empty)

### github-app-oauth (User authorization during installation)

The `github-app-oauth` is a combination of a GitHub App and OAuth. Use this when a GitHub App needs approval to be installed into an organization.

When setting up a GitHub App OAuth in Nango:

- **App ID**: Made of numbers (e.g. 401953)
- **App Public Link**: The URL to your GitHub App public page (e.g. https://github.com/apps/nango-github-app)
- **App Private Key**: Needs to be generated in your GitHub App settings and starts with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` (not to be confused with the Client Secrets)
- **Callback URL**: Needs to be filled in with the callback URL which unless customized will be https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback
- **Request user authorization during installation**: The checkbox "Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation" should be checked
- **Post installation settings**: The checkbox "Redirect on update" under "Post installation" should NOT be checked and the "Setup URL (optional)" should not be accessible

<Warning>
Nango supports initiating a connection with a GitHub App using the frontend SDK, but not directly from the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace). Therefore, you should encourage users to install your GitHub App from your product, rather than from the GitHub Marketplace directly. This is a limitation we plan to fix in the future.
</Warning>
