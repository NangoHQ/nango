# Overview

To authenticate with Bird, you will need:
1. **Subdomain** - The subdomain of your Bird API instance
2. **Access Key** - Your Bird access key for API authentication

This guide will walk you through finding your **Subdomain** and creating your **Access Key**.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a Bird account
- You must have access to the Bird Dashboard

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding your subdomain

The subdomain is the part of the Bird API you wish to connect to—i.e. the host in the base URL before `.bird.com`. It varies by api and region:

- **Emails API**
  - EU workspaces: `https://email.eu-west-1.api.bird.com` → subdomain is `email.eu-west-1.api`
  - US workspaces: `https://email.us-west-2.api.bird.com` → subdomain is `email.us-west-2.api`
- **MessageBird (general) API:** `https://api.bird.com/` → subdomain is `api`
- **Base media URL** (for retrieving media): `https://media.api.bird.com` → subdomain is `media.api`

You can confirm the correct base URL and subdomain for your use case by checking the [Bird API documentation](https://docs.bird.com/api).

#### Step 2: Creating an Access Key

1. Log in to your Bird account and navigate to the [Access keys](https://app.bird.com/settings/organization/access-keys) page in your Bird dashboard.

#### Step 3: Finding your workspace ID

From the same [Access keys](https://app.bird.com/settings/organization/access-keys) page, check the URL in your browser address bar. It has the form:

`https://app.bird.com/workspaces/<WORKSPACE_ID>/iam/access-keys`

Your workspace ID is the value between `workspaces/` and `/iam`.

#### Step 4: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Subdomain**, **Workspace ID**, and **Access Key**:

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Bird
2. Enter your **Subdomain**, **Workspace ID**, and **Access Key** in their respective fields
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated
