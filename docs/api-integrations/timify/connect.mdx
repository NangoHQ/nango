# Overview

To authenticate with Timify, you will need:
1. **App ID** - The identifier for your app in the Developer Platform.
2. **App Secret** - The secret used with your App ID to obtain access tokens for API authentication.

This guide will walk you through creating an app, getting these credentials, and connecting in Nango.

### Prerequisites

- Access to the TIMIFY Developer Platform. Request this from your Account Manager; they will arrange a developer account. You receive an invitation by email and must accept it within 7 days.
- Access to a Company or Enterprise account where the app can be installed.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding your subdomain

1. The subdomain is the first part of your API base URL, for example, in `https://api.timify.com` the subdomain is `api`.

#### Step 2: Create and install the app

1. Log in to the [Timify Developer Platform](https://api.timify.com) and go to **Apps** to see the **App Dashboard** → **+ NEW APP**.

4. Select **Scopes** for your integration (you can change these while the app is in Draft).

<Tip>
Install the app on your **Enterprise** account if you need it across multiple companies/branches. One app can be installed on only one account (company or enterprise).

#### Step 3: Getting your credentials

1. In the Developer Platform, open your app and go to **App Overview** (right-hand panel).
2. Copy **App ID** and **App Secret**.

Each app has a lifecycle status (Draft, Pending, Approved, etc.) that affects editability and usage. See [App Status](https://docs.timify.dev/docs/first-steps#app-status) in the Timify docs.

#### Step 4: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Subdomain**, **App ID**, and **App Secret**:

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Timify.
2. Enter your **Subdomain** (e.g. `api` for https://api.timify.com), **App ID**, and **App Secret** in their respective fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
