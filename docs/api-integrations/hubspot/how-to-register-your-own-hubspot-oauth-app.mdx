This guide shows you how to create a HubSpot app and obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their HubSpot account.

## Creating a HubSpot App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a developer account">
    Go to [HubSpot's developer signup page](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/developers) and create an account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create & configure a HubSpot app">
    1. Click the **Create app** button
    2. Give your app a name and fill in the required information
    3. Navigate to the **Auth** tab
    4. Configure the Redirect URL: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
    5. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** - you will need these when configuring your integration in Nango
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up the OAuth scopes">
    Still in the **Auth** tab, add the scopes that are relevant for your use case.

    Select only the permissions your app needs to function. For the full list of available scopes, see [HubSpot's OAuth scopes documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/working-with-oauth#scopes).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a HubSpot test account">
    If you don't have a HubSpot account already, [create one](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/crm) to test your integration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You're now ready to integrate HubSpot with Nango. For more details on HubSpot's OAuth implementation, see the [HubSpot API documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/reference/api/overview).
