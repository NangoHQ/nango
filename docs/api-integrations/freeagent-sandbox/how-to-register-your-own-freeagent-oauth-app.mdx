This guide shows you how to register your own app with FreeAgent Sandbox to obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their FreeAgent Sandbox account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a developer account">
    Go to the [FreeAgent Developer Dashboard](https://dev.freeagent.com/) and sign up for a developer account if you don't have one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register your application">
    1. Navigate to your [Apps page](https://dev.freeagent.com/apps).
    2. Click on the **Create New App** button.
    3. Fill in the required fields. For the **OAuth Redirect URIs**, enter `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
    4. Submit the form, and your app will be generated. The **OAuth identifier** will be your Client ID and the **OAuth secret** will be your Client Secret needed to configure this in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to connect your first account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>The same application can be used for both FreeAgent production and sandbox environments. The sandbox environment uses `api.sandbox.freeagent.com` as the base URL.</Note>

For more details, see [FreeAgent's OAuth 2.0 documentation](https://dev.freeagent.com/docs/quick_start).
