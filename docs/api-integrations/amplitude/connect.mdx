# Overview

To authenticate with Amplitude, you will need:
1. **API Key** - Your Amplitude API key for authentication.
2. **Secret Key** - Your Amplitude secret key for authentication.
3. **Hostname** - The hostname associated with your server residency.

This guide will walk you through generating your **API Key** and **Secret Key**, and finding your **Hostname** within Amplitude.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an Amplitude account with access to Organization settings and an Enterprise plan.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Generating your Amplitude API Key

1. Sign in to your [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) account.
2. Select **Organization settings** in the upper navigation.
3. Select **API Keys**. In the API Keys tab, you can see the legacy API key. This key was created along with the project.

3. Name the secret key and copy it to a secure location. 

<Tip> Amplitude doesn't store secret keys, and there is no way to retrieve them. (The Key ID is a unique identifier for your secret key, but it's not the key itself.) </Tip>

#### Step 3: Finding your Hostname (Optional)

The hostname is optional and depends on your Amplitude server residency. The default is the standard server:

- For **standard server** (default): Use `amplitude.com` or leave blank
- For **EU residency server**: Use `analytics.eu.amplitude.com`

#### Step 4: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **API Key**, **Secret Key**, and **Hostname**:

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Amplitude.
2. Enter your **API Key**, **Secret Key** and **Hostname** in their respective fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
