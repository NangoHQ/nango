# Overview

To authenticate with 8x8, you need:
1. **Client ID** - The client ID from your 8x8 Admin Console.
2. **Client Secret** - The client secret from your 8x8 Admin Console.

This guide will walk you through obtaining your API credentials from the 8x8 Admin Console.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an 8x8 account with admin access.
- You need access to the [8x8 Admin Console](https://admin.8x8.com/).

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Obtaining Your Client Credentials

1. Log in to the [8x8 Admin Console](https://admin.8x8.com/) with your administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to **Home** > **API Management** in the left-hand menu.

3. Click **Create API App** to create a new application.

4. Enter a name and description for your application.

5. Select the API products you want to enable for this application. Available products include:
   - CC Realtime Analytics
   - CC Historical Analytics
   - Cloud Storage Service
   - Quality Management
   - Contact Center Chat

6. Click **Save** to create the application.

7. After the application is created, you will be provided with:
   - **Client ID** - This is your API username
   - **Client Secret** - This is your API password (shown only once, so save it securely)

<Note>
The Client Secret is only displayed once when you create the application. Make sure to copy and store it securely. If you lose it, you'll need to regenerate a new secret.
</Note>

#### Step 2: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**:

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with 8x8.
2. Enter your **Client ID** in its designated field.
3. Enter your **Client Secret** in its designated field.
4. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.

## API Access Notes

The OAuth authentication for 8x8 XCaaS APIs uses the client credentials grant type. The access token:
- Is valid for approximately 30 minutes (1799 seconds)
- Should be refreshed before expiration or when you receive an authentication error
- Is passed via the Authorization header as `Bearer {access_token}` in all API requests

Nango handles token refresh automatically, so you don't need to manage token expiration manually.
