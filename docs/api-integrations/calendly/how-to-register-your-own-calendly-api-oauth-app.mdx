This guide shows you how to register your own app with Calendly to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Calendly account.

## Creating a Calendly OAuth App

<Steps>
   <Step title="Create a Calendly developer account">
     If you don't already have one, [create a Calendly developer account](https://developer.calendly.com/create-a-developer-account).
   </Step>

   <Step title="Register a new application">
     In your Calendly developer dashboard, navigate to the OAuth applications section and create a new application.
   </Step>

   <Step title="Configure your OAuth app">
     Fill in the required information for your application:
     - **Application Name**: Enter a name for your application
     - **Redirect URI**: Enter your Nango callback URL (found in your [Nango integration settings](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations))

     <Note>Only HTTPS redirect URIs will work when your app is in production.</Note>
   </Step>

   <Step title="Save your credentials">
     After creating the application, you'll receive a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Copy these credentials.
   </Step>

   <Step title="Add credentials to Nango">
     In Nango, go to your [Calendly integration](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) and enter:
     - **Client ID**: Your Calendly OAuth Client ID
     - **Client Secret**: Your Calendly OAuth Client Secret
   </Step>
</Steps>
