This guide shows you how to register your own app with Discord to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Discord account.

## Creating a Discord Application

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign in to Discord Developer Portal">
    Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and sign in with your Discord account.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create a new application">
    Click the "New Application" button in the top right corner. Enter a name for your application and click "Create".
    </Step>

    <Step title="Navigate to OAuth2 settings">
    In the left sidebar, click on "OAuth2" to access the OAuth2 configuration page.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Copy your credentials">
    On the OAuth2 page, you'll find your:
    - **Client ID**: Copy this value
    - **Client Secret**: Click "Reset Secret" to generate a new secret (or use an existing one), then copy it

    <Warning>Keep your client secret secure and never share it publicly.</Warning>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add redirect URL">
    Scroll down to the "Redirects" section and add your Nango callback URL:

    ```
    https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback
    ```

    Click "Add Redirect" to save it.

    <Tip>For local development, you can also add `http://localhost:3003/oauth/callback`</Tip>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select OAuth2 scopes">
    Scroll down to the "OAuth2 URL Generator" section to see available scopes. Common scopes include:
    - `identify`: Access basic user information
    - `email`: Access user's email address
    - `guilds`: Access user's guilds (servers)
    - `connections`: Access user's connected accounts

    For a complete list of scopes, see [Discord's OAuth2 scopes documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add credentials to Nango">
    In Nango, go to your Discord integration settings and add:
    - **Client ID**: Paste the Client ID from step 4
    - **Client Secret**: Paste the Client Secret from step 4
    - **Scopes**: Add the scopes you need (e.g., `identify email guilds`)

    Save your configuration.
    </Step>
</Steps>
