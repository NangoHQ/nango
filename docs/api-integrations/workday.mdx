## 🚀 Quickstart

Connect to Workday with Nango and see data flow in 2 minutes.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create the integration">
    In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Workday_.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Authorize Workday">
    Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Workday. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Call the Workday SOAP API">
    Let's make your first request to the Workday SOAP API (fetch workers using Human_Resources service). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
    <Tabs>
        <Tab title="Node">

        Install Nango's backend SDK and SOAP library with `npm i @nangohq/node soap`. Then run:

        ```typescript
        import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';
        import soap from 'soap';

        const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });
        const connectionId = '<CONNECTION-ID>';
        const providerConfigKey = '<INTEGRATION-ID>';

        const connection = await nango.getConnection(providerConfigKey, connectionId);
        const { credentials, connection_config } = connection;

        if (
          credentials.type !== "BASIC" ||
          !credentials.username ||
          !credentials.password ||
          !connection_config["hostname"] ||
          !connection_config["tenant"]
        ) {
          throw new Error(
            "Invalid credentials: BASIC auth, username, password, hostname, and tenant are all required."
          );
        }

        // Example: Get workers using Human_Resources service
        const serviceType = 'Human_Resources';
        const version = '40.0';
        const wsdlUrl = `https://community.workday.com/sites/default/files/file-hosting/productionapi/${serviceType}/v${version}/${serviceType}.wsdl`;
        const endpointUrl = `https://${connection_config["hostname"]}/ccx/service/${connection_config["tenant"]}/${serviceType}/v${version}`;


        const client = await soap.createClientAsync(wsdlUrl, {});
        client.addHttpHeader("Accept-Encoding", "gzip, deflate"); // Needed or some queries will fail https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/4806

        client.setSecurity(
          new soap.WSSecurity(credentials.username, credentials.password),
        );
        client.setEndpoint(endpointUrl);

        // Make SOAP request to Get_WorkersAsync
        const [res] = await client["Get_WorkersAsync"]({
          Response_Filter: {
            Page: 1,
            Count: 100,
          },
        });

        console.log('Workers Response:', JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
        ```
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.
