## 🚀 Quickstart

Connect to WorkOS with Nango and see data flow in 2 minutes.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create the integration">
    In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _WorkOS_.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Authorize WorkOS">
    Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then enter your API key. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Call the WorkOS API">
    Let's make your first request to the WorkOS API (list connections). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
    <Tabs>
        <Tab title="cURL">

            ```bash
            curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/connections?limit=1" \
              -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
              -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
              -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
            ```

        </Tab>

        <Tab title="Node">

        Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

        ```typescript
        import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

        const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

        const res = await nango.get({
            endpoint: '/connections',
            providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
            connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>',
            params: { limit: '1' }
        });

        console.log(res.data);
        ```
        </Tab>

    </Tabs>
    Or fetch credentials with the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Implement Nango in your app">
        Follow our [Auth implementation guide](/implementation-guides/platform/auth/implement-api-auth) to integrate Nango in your app.

        To obtain your own production credentials, follow the setup guide linked below.
    </Step>
