This guide shows you how to register your own app with HighLevel to obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID and client secret) for the HighLevel (LeadConnector) option. These are required to let your users grant your app access to their HighLevel account.

<Note>
HighLevel offers two different authorization flows for their users. The `standard` option allows for general OAuth2 authentication, while the `highlevel-white-label` (HighLevel (LeadConnector)) option allows users to generate access tokens, enabling them to white-label the platform. This means users can rebrand the platform with their own branding elements and customize it to match their brand identity.

## Important Notes

- **App Type**: The App Type determines the accessibility and visibility of your application. A public app is available for anyone to use and access, while a private app is restricted to a specific group or individuals and is not publicly listed in the marketplace.
- **Access Levels**: When creating an app, there are 2 types of access: Location Level Access (also known as Sub-Account) and Agency Level Access (also known as Company). These access levels provide comprehensive control over location data at either the individual location or agency-wide level.

For more details, see [HighLevel's OAuth documentation](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/Authorization/OAuth2.0/index.html).
