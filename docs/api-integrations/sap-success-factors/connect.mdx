# Overview

To authenticate with SAP SuccessFactors, you need:
1. **API Server** - The base URL of your SAP SuccessFactors OData API instance.
2. **Company ID** - Your company's unique identifier in SAP SuccessFactors.
3. **API Key** - The API Key (Client ID) generated during the OAuth client application registration process in SAP SuccessFactors.
4. **Private Key** - The private key extracted from the X.509 certificate downloaded from SAP SuccessFactors.
5. **Username** - Your SAP SuccessFactors username.

Nango will automatically generate the SAML Assertion using these credentials during the authentication process.

This guide will walk you through obtaining these credentials within SAP SuccessFactors.

### Prerequisites:
