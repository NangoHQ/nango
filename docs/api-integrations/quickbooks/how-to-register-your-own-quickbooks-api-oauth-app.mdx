This guide shows you how to register your own app with Quickbooks to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Quickbooks account.

## Creating a Quickbooks App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Intuit Developer account">
    Go to [Intuit Developer signup page](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/get-started) and create a free account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new app in your Developer account">
    1. From your Developer Dashboard, navigate to **My Hub** > **App Dashboard**, then click on the **Add** button.
    2. Select **QuickBooks Online and Payments**, click **Next** and provide a name for your app.
    3. Click **Next** to proceed with adding permissions to your app.
    4. Once you have added permissions, click **Done** and confirm the permissions you selected. Your application will be created.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OAuth settings">
    In the app you just created:
    1. Navigate to the **Settings** page, then go to the **Redirect URIs** tab and add the following URL: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
    2. Save your changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain API credentials">
    1. Still in your created app, navigate to **Keys and credentials** page and toggle the **Show credentials** button to locate your app's credentials.
    2. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
    3. You will need these credentials when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a development/sandbox account for testing">
    If you don't have a QuickBooks account already:
    1. From your Developer Dashboard, go to **My Hub** > **Sandbox**, then click **Add** to create a new Sandbox company.
    2. Follow the prompts to create a test company.
    3. Note the **Company ID/Realm ID** as you'll need it for API requests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Quickbooks Requirements

Quickbooks has flexible requirements for developers:

- **Developer account**: Free self-signup available
- **Test accounts**: Development/sandbox companies can be created for free from your Developer account
- **App review**: Only required for apps published to the Intuit App Store
- **Partnership**: Not required

## Important Notes

<Note>
QuickBooks requires a company ID/realmId for each API request. Nango can automatically retrieve this for you, or you can manually override it by specifying the realmId when creating a new connection. You can use [getConnection](/reference/functions#get-the-connection-credentials) in your [integration function](/guides/primitives/functions) to retrieve it, or when you fetch the Connection credentials with the REST API or SDK.
</Note>

<Note>
For sandbox testing, use the `quickbooks-sandbox` integration in Nango instead of the regular `quickbooks` integration.
</Note>

<Note>
QuickBooks access tokens expire after 1 hour, but Nango automatically handles token refresh for you.
</Note>

## Relevant Scopes

When setting up your app, you'll need to configure OAuth scopes. Quickbooks uses the following main scopes:

- `com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting` - Access to QuickBooks accounting data (most commonly used)
- `com.intuit.quickbooks.payment` - Access to QuickBooks payments data

For a complete list of available scopes, see [Quickbooks OAuth scopes documentation](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/learn/scopes#current-scopes).

For more details on Quickbooks OAuth implementation, see [Quickbooks OAuth 2.0 guide](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0).
