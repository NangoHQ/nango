This guide shows you how to obtain an API key from Apollo to authenticate your integration with Nango. Apollo uses API key authentication with the `x-api-key` header to access various endpoints.

## Prerequisites

Apollo offers a free account with self-signup. You can create an account at [apollo.io/sign-up](https://www.apollo.io/sign-up).

- No paid account required
- No partnership required
- No app review or security audit required

## Obtaining your Apollo API key

To generate an API key for your Apollo account:

1. Sign up for a free Apollo account at [apollo.io/sign-up](https://www.apollo.io/sign-up) if you don't have one
2. Follow the [Apollo API key generation guide](https://developer.apollo.io/keys/) to create your API key
3. Test your API key using the [Apollo API documentation](https://docs.apollo.io/docs/test-api-key#test-apollo-apis-in-documentation)

<Note>Apollo uses API_KEY auth mode with `x-api-key: API_KEY` in the request header to access various endpoints.</Note>

## Using your API key with Nango

Once you have your API key:

1. Go to the [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) page in your Nango dashboard
2. Find your Apollo integration and click to configure it
3. Enter your API key in the credentials section
4. Test the connection to verify it works
