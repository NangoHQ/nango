# Overview

To authenticate with Adobe Commerce, you will need:
1. **Store Domain** - The domain of your Adobe Commerce store.
2. **Store Code** - The store code for your Adobe Commerce store (e.g., "default").
3. **Access Token** - Your Adobe Commerce access token for authentication.

This guide will walk you through finding your store information and obtaining your **Access Token** within Adobe Commerce.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an active Adobe Commerce account
- You must have admin access to your Adobe Commerce Admin panel

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding your Store Domain

Your store domain is the base URL of your Adobe Commerce store (e.g., `yourstore.com` or `mystore.magento.com`). This is the domain where your Adobe Commerce store is hosted.

Once logged in to your Adobe Commerce Admin panel, you can check the address bar in your browser—the store domain is the text between the protocol (e.g., `https://`) and the first slash (`/`).

#### Step 2: Finding your Store Code

The store code is typically `default` for the main store, but you can find it by:
1. Log in to your Adobe Commerce Admin panel.
2. Navigate to **Stores** > **All Stores**. In the Store view column, select the store you want to connect to.

Before you create the connection in Nango, you should first obtain your Access Token in your Adobe Commerce account.

To obtain your Access Token:

1. Navigate to **System** > **Extensions** > **Integrations** on the Admin sidebar.

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Adobe Commerce.
2. Enter your **Store Domain**, **Store Code**, and **Access Token** in their respective fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
