# Overview

To authenticate with ConnectWise RMM, you need:
1. **API Subdomain** - The region-specific OpenAPI subdomain for your tenant
2. **Client ID** - Your OAuth client ID
3. **Client Secret** - Your OAuth client secret

### Prerequisites:

- Access to your ConnectWise RMM tenant as an administrator.
- Permission to create or manage API credentials.

### Instructions:

##### Step 1: Find your API subdomain

Use the subdomain that matches your tenant region:

- US: `itsupport247.net`
- EU: `euplatform.connectwise.com`
- AU: `auplatform.connectwise.com`

##### Step 2: Create API credentials

In your ConnectWise RMM tenant:

1. Open the API/integration settings for your tenant.
2. Create (or reuse) an OAuth client that supports the Client Credentials flow.
3. Copy the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

<Note>
Store the Client Secret securely. If your admin portal only shows it once, save it in a secret manager immediately.
</Note>

##### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with ConnectWise RMM.
2. Enter:
   - **API Subdomain**
   - **Client ID**
   - **Client Secret**
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.

You are now connected to ConnectWise RMM.
