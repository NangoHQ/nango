This guide shows you how to register your own app with Notion to obtain your OAuth credentials (client ID & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Notion account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Notion account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Notion account](https://www.notion.so/signup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new integration">
    1. Go to [My Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) in your Notion account.
    2. Click **+ New integration**.
    3. Select **Public** as the integration type, then fill in the integration details. For the **Redirect URIs**, add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
    4. Click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain API credentials">
    1. After saving, click **Configure integration settings**.
    2. Under the **Configuration** tab, copy your **OAuth Client ID** and **OAuth Client Secret**. You'll need these when configuring your integration in Nango.
    3. Under the **Capabilities** section, select the [capabilities](https://developers.notion.com/reference/capabilities) your integration requires.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>When creating a Notion OAuth app, it is set to **Internal** by default. You need to make it **Public** to initiate an OAuth flow with users. Only then will you be able to obtain the OAuth client ID/secret and register your callback URL.</Note>

<Note>The Notion OAuth API doesn't support refreshing tokens, and so doesn't return a refresh token. The access token never expires.</Note>

<Note>No OAuth scope is required by default for Notion integrations.</Note>

<Note>After authorization, users need to explicitly share specific pages or databases with your integration before you can access them.</Note>

For more details on Notion's OAuth implementation, see [Notion's authentication documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization) and [OAuth setup guide](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#public-integration-auth-flow-set-up).
