# Overview

To authenticate with Atlassian using OAuth 2.0 service account credentials, you will need:
1. **Client ID** - The OAuth 2.0 client ID from your service account credential.
2. **Client Secret** - The OAuth 2.0 client secret from your service account credential.
3. **Subdomain** (optional) - Your Atlassian account subdomain.

This guide will walk you through creating OAuth 2.0 credentials for your service account and finding your subdomain.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an Atlassian account with admin access
- You must have created a service account

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Creating OAuth Client Credentials

1. Go to **Atlassian Administration**. Select your organization if you have more than one.
2. Select **Directory** > **Service accounts**.
3. Select the service account you want to create a credential for.
4. Select **Create credentials**.

7. Review your OAuth information, then select **Create**.
8. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and save them somewhere safe. You can't recover them after you create the credential.

<Tip>Store your Client ID and Client Secret securely. If you lose them, you'll need to create new credentials.</Tip>

#### Step 2: Finding your Subdomain

1. Log in to your Atlassian cloud site.
2. Once logged in, check the address bar in your browser. Your subdomain is the text between `https://` and `.atlassian.net` in the URL.
    - For example, if your URL is `https://acme.atlassian.net`, your subdomain is `acme`.

<Note>The subdomain is optional. Since a single access token can have access to many resources, you can either provide a `Subdomain` during connection creation (recommended) to ensure you connect to a specific Atlassian site, or let Nango auto-select the first available site if no `Subdomain` is specified. Adding the subdomain ensures you connect to the intended site.</Note>

#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** (and optionally your **Subdomain**):
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Atlassian Service Account (OAuth 2.0).
2. Enter your **Subdomain**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** in their respective fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
