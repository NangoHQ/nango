# Overview

To authenticate with Looker, you will need:
1. **Looker Instance Hostname** - Your Looker instance hostname (e.g., `mycompany.looker.com`)
2. **Client ID** - A unique identifier for your client.
3. **Client Secret** - A confidential key used to authenticate the identity of the application (client).

This guide will walk you through finding your **Looker Instance Hostname** and obtaining your **Client Credentials**.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a Looker account with admin access

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding your Looker hostname

Your Looker instance hostname is the API URL for accessing your Looker instance's API. The hostname format depends on your Looker instance configuration.

**Option 1: Check the API Host URL in Looker Admin (Recommended)**

1. Log into your Looker instance with admin access.
2. Navigate to **Admin** > **API**.
3. Check the **API Host URL** field. This shows your configured API path.
4. If an API Host URL is specified, use that value as your hostname (without the `https://` prefix).
5. If the API Host URL field is not configured, you can use this field to assign an API path that is different from your Looker server machine name. 

#### Step 2: Obtaining your client credentials

To generate your Client ID and Client Secret:

1. Log into your Looker instance with admin access.
2. Navigate to **Admin** > **Users** and select your user account.
3. Click the **API** section and select **Create API3 Key**.
4. A new **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be generated.

#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Looker Instance Hostname**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**:

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Looker.
2. Enter your **Looker Instance Hostname**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** in their respective fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
