# Overview

To authenticate with Looker Studio, you will need:
1. **Looker Studio Instance Hostname** - Your Looker Studio instance hostname (e.g., `mycompany.looker.com`)
2. **Client ID** - A unique identifier for your client.
3. **Client Secret** - A confidential key used to authenticate the identity of the application (client).

This guide will walk you through finding your **Looker Studio Instance Hostname** and obtaining your **Client Credentials**.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a Looker Studio account with admin access

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding your Looker Studio hostname

Your Looker Studio instance hostname is the API URL for accessing your Looker Studio instance's API. The hostname format depends on your Looker Studio instance configuration.

**Option 1: Check the API Host URL in Looker Studio Admin (Recommended)**

1. Log into your Looker Studio instance with admin access.
2. Navigate to **Admin** > **API**.
3. Check the **API Host URL** field. This shows your configured API path.
4. If an API Host URL is specified, use that value as your hostname (without the `https://` prefix).
5. If the API Host URL field is not configured, you can use this field to assign an API path that is different from your Looker Studio server machine name. 

#### Step 2: Obtaining your client credentials

To generate your Client ID and Client Secret:

1. Log into your Looker Studio instance with admin access.
2. Navigate to **Admin** > **Users** and select your user account.
3. Click the **API** section and select **Create API3 Key**.
4. A new **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be generated.

#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Looker Studio Instance Hostname**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**:

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Looker Studio.
2. Enter your **Looker Studio Instance Hostname**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** in their respective fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
