This guide shows you how to register your own app with Zoho CRM to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Zoho CRM account.

<Steps>
      <Step title="Create a Zoho account">
        If you don't already have one, go to [Zoho's signup page](https://www.zoho.com/signup.html) and create one.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Access the Zoho API Console">
        1. Go to the [Zoho API Console](https://api-console.zoho.com/).
        2. Sign in with your Zoho account if prompted.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create a new client">
        1. In the API Console, click on the **+ ADD CLIENT** button and select **Server-based Applications** as your client type.
        2. Fill in all the required information. For **Authorized Redirect URIs** enter `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
        3. Click **Create** to register your client. You will then receive a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, which are required to configure your integration in Nango.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure Multi-DC">
        1. On the **Settings** tab, check the option to use the same OAuth credentials for all data centers, this enables you to handle users from different regions
      </Step>
      <Step title="Next">
        Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
      </Step>
</Steps>

## Important considerations

- Zoho uses datacenter-specific URLs for authentication. Make sure to use the correct datacenter domain extension (`com`, `eu`, `in`, `com.cn`, `com.au`) based on where your user's account is registered.
- For production applications, consider implementing [multi-datacenter support](https://www.zoho.com/accounts/protocol/oauth/multi-dc.html) to handle users from different regions.
- For specific scopes, refer to the [API documentation](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/select-api-scopes.html) to find the exact scopes needed per API and per method.

## Common OAuth scopes

When configuring your Zoho CRM OAuth app, you may need the following scopes depending on your use case. See [Zoho's OAuth scopes documentation](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/select-api-scopes.html) for the complete list.
