# Overview

To connect Microsoft Teams Bot in Nango, you need to provide:

1. **Tenant ID** — The Azure AD tenant with an active MS Teams subscription.

This guide explains where to find your Tenant ID and how to enter it in the Connect UI.

### Step 1: Finding your Tenant ID

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. If you have multiple tenants, use the **Settings** (directory + subscription) icon to switch to the tenant that has your Microsoft Teams subscription.
3. In the left menu, go to **Microsoft Entra ID** (or **Azure Active Directory**).
4. Open **Overview**. Your **Tenant ID** (a GUID such as `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-47a8-9b0c-d1234567890f`) is shown as **Tenant ID** or **Directory ID**.

### Step 2: Enter values in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Tenant ID**:

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Microsoft Teams Bot.
2. Enter your **Tenant ID** in its designated field.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
