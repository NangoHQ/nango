# Overview

To authenticate with Workday (Refresh Token), you will need:
1. **Token Domain** - The domain used to obtain tokens for your Workday account
2. **Tenant** - The tenant of your Workday account
3. **Client ID** - Your Workday API Client ID
4. **Client Secret** - Your Workday API Client Secret
5. **Refresh Token** - Your Workday refresh token for the Integration System User (ISU)

This guide will walk you through finding your connection configuration values and obtaining your API client credentials.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an active Workday account with administrator access
- You must have access to register API clients for integrations

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Finding your Token Domain
1. Log in to your Workday instance.
2. In your Workday homepage, go to the search bar and type **View API Clients** then select it.
3. You can locate your **Token Domain** within the **Token Endpoint** field.
4. The **Token Domain** is everything after `https://` and before `ccx`.
- Example: If the endpoint is ` https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/oauth2/acme/token`, your **Token Domain** is `wd2-impl-services1.workday.com`.

#### Step 2: Finding your Tenant
1. In the same **Token Endpoint** field from the **View API Clients** report, the **Tenant** is the final part of the URL after `/oauth2/` and before `/token`.
- Example: If the endpoint is `https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/oauth2/acme/token`, your **Tenant** is `acme`.


#### Step 3: Registering an API Client

1. Navigate to **Register API Client for integration** in your Workday instance
2. Click **Register API Client for Integrations**

3. Enter a meaningful name to indicate that this API client is used for your integration (e.g., "Nango Integration")
4. Select **Non-Expiring Refresh Tokens** to ensure long lived access
5. Select all the OAuth2 scopes and Functional Area scopes that you need for the recipes you intend to create
6. Save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** before clicking **Done**. These will be required to create a Workday connection

#### Step 4: Generating a Refresh Token

After registering your API client, you need to generate a refresh token for your Integration System User (ISU).

1. Navigate to **Action** > **API Client** > **Manage Refresh Tokens for Integrations**

3. If there are no existing refresh tokens, select **Generate new refresh token**

4. Copy the new **Refresh Token** - this will be required to create a Workday connection


#### Step 5: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Token Domain**, **Tenant**, **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Refresh Token**:

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Workday (Refresh Token)
2. Enter your **Token Domain** in the Token Domain field
3. Enter your **Token Domain**, **Tenant**, **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Refresh Token** in their respective fields.
