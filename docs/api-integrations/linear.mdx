## 🚀 Quickstart

Connect to Linear with Nango and see data flow in 2 minutes.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create the integration">
    In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Linear_. Nango doesn't provide a test OAuth app for Linear yet. You'll need to set up your own by following the [setup guide](/api-integrations/linear/how-to-register-your-own-linear-api-oauth-app). After that, make sure to add the OAuth client ID, secret, and scopes in the integration settings in Nango.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Authorize Linear">
    Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Linear. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Call the Linear API">
    Let's make your first request to the Linear API (fetch a list of issues). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
    <Tabs>
        <Tab title="cURL">

            ```bash
            curl "https://api.nango.dev/proxy/graphql" \
              -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
              -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
              -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>" \
              -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
              -d '{
                    "query": "query { issues(first: 10) { nodes { id title identifier } } }"
                  }'
            ```

        </Tab>

        <Tab title="Node">

        Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

        ```typescript
        import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

        const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

        const res = await nango.post({
          endpoint: '/graphql',
          data: {
            "query": "query { issues(first: 10) { nodes { id title identifier } } }"
          },
          providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
          connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
        });

        console.log(JSON.stringify(res.data, 2, null));
        ```
        </Tab>


    </Tabs>

    Or fetch credentials with the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Implement Nango in your app">
        Follow our [quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart/embed-in-your-app) to integrate Nango in your app.

        To obtain your own production credentials, follow the setup guide linked below.
