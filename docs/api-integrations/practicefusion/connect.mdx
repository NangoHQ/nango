# Overview

To authenticate with PracticeFusion, you will need:
1. **Base URL** - The PracticeFusion authorization server base URL for your practice.

This guide will walk you through finding your **Base URL** from the PracticeFusion ServiceBaseURLs.json file.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have access to a PracticeFusion practice.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Find your Base URL

1. Download the [ServiceBaseURLs.json](https://www.practicefusion.com/assets/static_files/ServiceBaseURLs.json) file which contains all available PracticeFusion practice endpoints.
2. Open the downloaded JSON file and search for your practice by name or organization identifier. The file contains a FHIR Bundle with organization entries and their associated endpoints.
3. For each practice, you'll find endpoint entries with `fullUrl` values. Look for the endpoint with the name **"Provider / System Access"** and copy its `fullUrl` value.
4. Omit the `https://` prefix from the URL - this is your Base URL.

#### Step 2: Enter Base URL in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Base URL**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with PracticeFusion.
2. Enter the **Base URL** (without the `https://` prefix) in the respective field.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
