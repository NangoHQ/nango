## Important Notes

- **Business Account Required**: Personal API tokens are generated from a Wise Business profile.
- **Limited API Access**: Personal tokens have more limited API access compared to OAuth credentials.
- **PSD2 Restrictions (EU/UK)**: Due to PSD2 regulations, you **cannot** fund transfers or view balance statements via API with a personal token in the EU/UK.
- **Single User**: A personal token authenticates requests for a single Wise.com user only.
