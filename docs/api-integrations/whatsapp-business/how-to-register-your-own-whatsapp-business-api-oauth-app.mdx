This guide shows you how to obtain your WhatsApp Business API credentials (access token) to connect your application with the WhatsApp Business API through Nango.

## Understanding WhatsApp Business Authentication

WhatsApp Business uses API key authentication with access tokens. The access token is a JWT or OAuth2 token that authorizes requests to the WhatsApp Business API.

## Generating Your Access Token

To generate an access token for WhatsApp Business:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a Facebook Developer Account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Facebook Developer account](https://developers.facebook.com/).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create a WhatsApp Business App">
    Create a new app in the Facebook Developer Portal and add the WhatsApp product to your app.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Generate Access Token">
    Follow Facebook's guide to [generate an access token](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/solution-providers/get-started-for-solution-partners#get-access-token) for your WhatsApp Business app.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure in Nango">
    Once you have your access token:
    1. Go to the [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) page in Nango
    2. Select your WhatsApp Business integration
    3. Add your access token as the API key
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
For production use, you'll need to complete the WhatsApp Business API setup process, which may include business verification and phone number registration.
