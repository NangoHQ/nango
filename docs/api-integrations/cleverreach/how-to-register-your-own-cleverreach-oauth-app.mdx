This guide shows you how to register your own app with CleverReach to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their CleverReach account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a CleverReach account">
    If you don't already have one, [create a CleverReach account](https://www.cleverreach.com/).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new OAuth app">
    1. Log in to your CleverReach account.
    2. Navigate to **My Account** > **Extras** > **REST API**.
    3. Click **Create OAuth App** to register a new application.
    4. Fill in the required fields:
       - **App Name**: Enter a name for your application.
       - **Redirect URL**: Enter your Nango callback URL (found in your [Nango integration settings](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations)).
    5. Click **Save**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Obtain your credentials">
    After creating the app, you will see your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Copy these credentials.

    <Tip>Keep your Client Secret secure. If you lose it, you will need to regenerate it.</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/api-integrations/cleverreach).
