This guide shows you how to register your own OAuth application with Cloudbeds to obtain your OAuth credentials (Client ID & Client Secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Cloudbeds account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register Your OAuth App">
    1. If you don't already have a Cloudbeds account, go to [Cloudbeds](https://www.cloudbeds.com/) and register for one.
    2. Log in to your platform using your credentials at [https://signin.cloudbeds.com/](https://signin.cloudbeds.com/).
    3. Ensure that **API Keys Authentication** is enabled for your Partner Dev Account by the team at Cloudbeds.
    4. Navigate to the section to set up your **API Key Delivery method** and select **Automatic** delivery for API keys.
    5. Locate and note the **Client ID** issued by Cloudbeds.
    6. Click on **Generate New Secret** to retrieve your **Client Secret** for the first time or to reset it. You will need both the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** when setting up your integration in Nango.
    7. Specify your **redirect URL**: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
    8. Select the required **permission scopes** for the API endpoints you intend to use. You can find details on the scopes related to each endpoint in the [About Cloudbeds API](https://developers.cloudbeds.com/docs/about-cloudbeds-api) documentation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to start building your integration.
    
    <Note>You don't need to specify the scopes when configuring your integration in Nango, as it will use the already configured ones that were set when creating the app on Cloudbeds.</Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>
