## 🚀 Quickstart

Connect to Procore with Nango and see data flow in 2 minutes.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an integration">
    In Nango ([free signup](https://app.nango.dev)), go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) -> _Configure New Integration_ -> _Procore_.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Authorize Procore">
    Go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) -> _Add Test Connection_ -> _Authorize_, then log in to Procore. Later, you'll let your users do the same directly from your app.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Call the Procore API">
    Let's make your first request to the Procore API (retrieve a list of companies). Replace the placeholders below with your [secret key](https://app.nango.dev/dev/environment-settings), [integration ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), and [connection ID](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections):
    <Tabs>
        <Tab title="cURL">

            ```bash
            curl "https://api.nango.dev/rest/v1.0/companies" \
              -H "Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>" \
              -H "Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>" \
              -H "Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>"
            ```

        </Tab>

        <Tab title="Node">

        Install Nango's backend SDK with `npm i @nangohq/node`. Then run:

        ```typescript
        import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

        const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' });

        const response = await nango.get({
            endpoint: '/rest/v1.0/companies',
            params: {
                page: 1,
                per_page: 10
            },
            providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
            connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>'
        });

        console.log(response.data);
        ```
        </Tab>

    </Tabs>
    Or fetch credentials dynamically via the [Node SDK](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials) or [API](/reference/api/connection/get).

    ✅ You're connected! Check the [Logs](https://app.nango.dev/dev/logs) tab in Nango to inspect requests.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Implement Nango in your app">
        Follow our [quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart/embed-in-your-app) to integrate Nango in your app.

## 📚 Procore Integration Guides

Nango-maintained guides for common use cases.

- [How to register your own Procore OAuth app](/api-integrations/procore/how-to-register-your-own-procore-oauth-app)  
Register an OAuth app with Procore and obtain credentials to connect it to Nango

- [How to link your Procore account](/api-integrations/procore/connect)  
Connect your Procore account to Nango and configure connection settings

<Note>
**Company ID:** The `companyId` field is optional when connecting your Procore account. If you don't provide it, Nango will automatically retrieve the first company from the `/rest/v1.0/companies` endpoint after you complete the OAuth authorization and store it in the connection configuration.
