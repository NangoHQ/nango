This guide shows you how to register your own app with Twitter to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Twitter account.

<Note>The OAuth1 and OAuth2 APIs give access to different data. Both are supported by Nango. This guide covers OAuth 2.0.</Note>

## Creating a Twitter OAuth 2.0 App

<Steps>
   <Step title="Sign up for a Twitter Developer Account">
     If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Twitter Developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info). You'll need to verify your email and phone number.
   </Step>

   <Step title="Create a new Project and App">
     In the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard):
     1. Navigate to the Projects & Apps section
     2. Create a new Project (if you don't have one)
     3. Create a new App within your Project
   </Step>

   <Step title="Configure User Authentication Settings">
     Within your App settings:
     1. Go to the **User authentication settings** section
     2. Click **Set up** to configure OAuth 2.0
     3. Select **OAuth 2.0** as the authentication type
     4. Choose the appropriate **Type of App** (typically Web App, Automated App or Bot, or Native App)
     5. Add your callback URL from Nango (find this in your [Nango integration settings](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations))
   </Step>

   <Step title="Get your OAuth 2.0 credentials">
     After setting up user authentication:
     1. Your **Client ID** will be displayed in the User authentication settings
     2. Generate a **Client Secret** if you haven't already
     3. Save both the Client ID and Client Secret securely

     <Warning>The Client Secret is only shown once. Make sure to save it immediately.</Warning>
   </Step>

   <Step title="Configure OAuth scopes">
     Select the scopes your application needs. Common scopes include:
     - `tweet.read` - Read tweets
     - `users.read` - Read user profile information
     - `offline.access` - Get refresh tokens for long-lived access

     For a complete list of available scopes, see [Twitter's OAuth 2.0 scopes documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code#:~:text=a%20public%20client.-,Scopes,-Scopes%20allow%20you).
   </Step>

   <Step title="Add credentials to Nango">
     In your [Nango integration settings](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations):
     1. Find your Twitter v2 integration
     2. Add your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
     3. Configure any required OAuth scopes
     4. Save your settings
   </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>Twitter also offers a client credentials flow that authorizes as an app instead of a user. This is listed under `twitter-oauth2-cc` in Nango. For more details, check [Twitter's client credentials flow documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only).</Note>
