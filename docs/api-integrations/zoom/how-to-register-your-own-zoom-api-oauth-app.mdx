This guide shows you how to register your own app with Zoom to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Zoom account.

## Register your OAuth application

Follow these steps to create and configure your Zoom OAuth app:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a Zoom account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Zoom account](https://zoom.us/signup).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create an OAuth app">
    Go to the [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/) and click on "Develop" in the top navigation, then select "Build App".

    Choose "OAuth" as the app type and provide a name for your application.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure OAuth settings">
    In your app's configuration:

    - Add your redirect URL (e.g., `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` for Nango Cloud)
    - Select the OAuth scopes your application needs. Refer to [Zoom's OAuth scopes documentation](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/oauth-scopes/) for the full list.
    - Note your Client ID and Client Secret - you'll need these to configure Zoom in Nango
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure custom callback URL for production (optional)">
    When testing your Zoom application in the marketplace, Zoom requires you to verify your domain. For OAuth redirects, ensure you use a custom callback URL. This way, Zoom sees your own callback URL instead of Nango's.

    For more details, refer to the [implement API auth guide](/implementation-guides/api-auth/implement-api-auth#5-setup-a-custom-oauth-callback-url-optional).
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Add credentials to Nango

Once you have your Client ID and Client Secret:

1. Go to the [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) page in Nango
2. Find and select Zoom
3. Enter your Client ID and Client Secret
4. Save your configuration

Your users can now authorize their Zoom accounts through your application.

For more information about Zoom's OAuth implementation, see the [Zoom OAuth documentation](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/oauth).
