This guide shows you how to register your own app with ClickUp to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their ClickUp account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a ClickUp account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a [ClickUp account](https://app.clickup.com/signup).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new OAuth app">
    1. In the upper-right corner, click on your avatar and select **Settings**.
    2. In the left sidebar, click **Apps**.
    3. Click the **Create new app** button.

    <Note>Only Workspace owners or admins can create OAuth apps.</Note>

    4. Fill in all the required information. For the **Redirect URL**, add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.
    5. Click **Create App**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Obtain OAuth credentials">
    1. After creating your app, you'll receive a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Make a copy of these as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your integration in Nango">
    Follow the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) to add your OAuth credentials to your ClickUp integration in Nango.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>ClickUp does not use scopes in their OAuth implementation, so you can leave the scope field empty when configuring your integration in Nango.</Note>

<Note>Users can authorize one or more Workspaces for your application. Use the [Get Authorized Teams (Workspaces)](https://developer.clickup.com/reference/getauthorizedteams) endpoint to see which Workspaces are authorized.</Note>

For more details on ClickUp's OAuth implementation, see [ClickUp's OAuth Flow documentation](https://developer.clickup.com/docs/authentication#build-apps-for-others---oauth-flow).
