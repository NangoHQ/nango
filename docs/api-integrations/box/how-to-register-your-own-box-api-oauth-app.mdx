This guide shows you how to register your own app with Box to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Box account.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a Box account">
        If you don't already have one, sign up for a free trial [Box account](https://www.box.com/pricing).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create a new application">
        1. Go to the [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console).
        2. Click **Create Platform App**.
        3. Select **Custom App** as your **Platform App** from the list of application types.
        4. Enter the basic application details and choose **User Authentication (OAuth 2.0)** as your app's **Authentication Method**.
        5. In your app's **Configuration** tab, add `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` as your **Redirect URI**, then click **Save Changes**.
        6. Scroll down to the **Application Scopes** section and select the scopes you need.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Obtain OAuth credentials">
        1. In the same **Configuration** tab, under the **OAuth 2.0 Credentials** section, copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, you'll need these when configuring your integration in Nango.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Start building your integration">
        Follow the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) guide to build your integration.
    </Step>
</Steps>
