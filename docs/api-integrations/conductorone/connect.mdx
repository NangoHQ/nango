# Overview

To authenticate with ConductorOne, you will need:
1. **Hostname** - The hostname extracted from your Client ID (the portion between the @ and / symbols).
2. **Client ID** - Your ConductorOne API client identifier in the format `<random-id>@<hostname>/<use-case>`.
3. **Client Secret** - A secret token used in conjunction with your Client ID to generate an access token for API authentication.

This guide will walk you through obtaining your **Hostname**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** within ConductorOne.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a ConductorOne account.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Obtaining Your Client Credentials

1. In the ConductorOne app, navigate to the **User API Settings** page by clicking your username at the bottom of the screen and selecting **API Keys**.
2. Click **Create credential**.
3. Enter a descriptive name for your API key and submit the form.
4. Your new key is created, and its **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are generated and displayed.

The Client ID follows a stable format that includes a random ID, the base hostname, and the use-case. It is represented in the format: `<random-id>@<hostname>/<use-case>`. For example: `strange-hydra-68836@acme.conductor.one/pcc`.

The Client Secret follows the format: `secret-token:conductorone.com:${base64url encoded JWK}`. It contains an ed25519 private key that you may parse to extract the private key.

#### Step 2: Obtaining Your Hostname

Your Client ID is in the format `<random-id>@<hostname>/<use-case>`. The hostname for your API client is the portion of your Client ID immediately following the `@` symbol and preceding the `/` symbol.

For instance, for the Client ID `strange-hydra-68836@acme.conductor.one/pcc`, the hostname is `acme.conductor.one`.

#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

Once you have your **Hostname**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**:

1. Open the form Hostname you need to authenticate with ConductorOne.
2. Enter your **Hostname**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** in their respective fields.
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
