# Overview

To authenticate with ResearchDesk, you will need:

1. **Subdomain** – The subdomain for the environment you want to connect to.
2. **Email** – Your ResearchDesk account email.
3. **Password** – Your ResearchDesk account password.

This guide walks you through choosing your environment and using your ResearchDesk credentials in the Connect UI.

### Prerequisites

- A ResearchDesk account.

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Choosing your subdomain

ResearchDesk uses different base URLs for production and staging. In the Connect UI, you will be asked for the **Environment** (subdomain). Use one of these values:

| Environment           | Subdomain       | Base URL                            |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Production            | `demand`        | https://demand.researchdesk.com     |
| Integration Staging  | `stage-demand`  | https://stage-demand.researchdesk.com |

Enter **demand** for production or **stage-demand** for integration staging.

#### Step 2: Finding your credentials

Use the **email** and **password** you use to sign in to ResearchDesk. These are the same credentials you use for the ResearchDesk dashboard.

#### Step 3: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with ResearchDesk.
2. Enter the **Subdomain** (`demand` or `stage-demand`).
3. Enter your **Email** and **Password** in their respective fields.
4. Submit the form to create the connection.
