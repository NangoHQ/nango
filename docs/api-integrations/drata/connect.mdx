# Overview

To authenticate with Drata, you need:
1. **API Key** - A key that grants secure access to the Drata API, enabling authorized applications to interact with Drata resources and services.

This guide will walk you through generating your **API Key** within Drata.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a Drata account
- You must have admin access to create API keys

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Creating Your API Key

1. Go to the **Settings** page on Drata. To access settings, select your account on the bottom left side navigation and then select the **Settings** option.
2. Select **API Keys** on the Settings page.
3. Select the **Create API Key** button.
4. Fill in all the **API Key** details, for:
   - **Allowed IP Addresses**: You can restrict key usage to the specified addresses. Please reach out to Nango support to get the current IPs to whitelist here.
5. Enter the scopes for your API:
   - **Access**: The options are Custom, All read, or All read and write.
   - **Custom**: Select the specific scopes you want enabled for that API key.
   - **All read**: Enable all the current and future read permissions/scopes for the API key.
   - **All read and write**: Enable all the current and future permissions/scopes for the API key.
6. Once you save, you will be prompted to acknowledge that you have saved your API key info in a secure location.
7. Copy your **API Key** immediately - you will not be able to access the full API key again after selecting Done.
