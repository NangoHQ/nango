This guide shows you how to register your own app with Dropbox to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Dropbox account.

## Creating a Dropbox App

<Steps>
   <Step title="Register for a Dropbox developer account">
     If you don't already have one, sign up for a [Dropbox developer account](https://www.dropbox.com/developers).
   </Step>

   <Step title="Create a new app">
     Go to the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) and click "Create app".

     Choose your API type and access level:
     - **Scoped access**: Recommended for most applications, provides granular permission control
     - **Full Dropbox access** or **App folder access**: Choose based on your app's needs
   </Step>

   <Step title="Configure OAuth settings">
     In your app's settings:
     1. Add your **OAuth Redirect URI**: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
     2. Note your **App key** (Client ID) and **App secret** (Client Secret)
   </Step>

   <Step title="Configure permissions">
     Navigate to the **Permissions** tab in your app console.

     Select the appropriate scopes for your application. Common scopes include:
     - `files.metadata.read` - Read file and folder metadata
     - `files.metadata.write` - Create, edit, and delete files and folders
     - `files.content.read` - Read file content
     - `files.content.write` - Upload and modify file content

     <Note>Changes to permissions require users to re-authorize your app to grant the new scopes.</Note>
   </Step>

   <Step title="Add credentials to Nango">
     In Nango:
     1. Go to the [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations) page
     2. Find and select **Dropbox**
     3. Enter your **App key** as the Client ID
     4. Enter your **App secret** as the Client Secret
     5. Add any required scopes in the configuration
     6. Click **Save**
   </Step>
</Steps>
