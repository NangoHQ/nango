This guide shows you how to register your own app with Constant Contact to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Constant Contact account.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, note the following requirements for Constant Contact API access:

- You must have a Constant Contact account

## Registering your application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a developer account">
    Go to the [Constant Contact V3 API Developer Portal](https://developer.constantcontact.com/) and sign in with your Constant Contact account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new application">
    1. Navigate to the [My Applications](https://app.constantcontact.com/pages/dma/portal/) tab in the Developer Portal
    2. Click **Create New Application** or **Add Application**
    3. Fill in all the required details.
    4. In **Application OAuth2 Settings**, select: **Authorization Code Flow and Implicit Flow.**
    5. For **Refresh Token Type**, select **Rotating Refresh Tokens**
    6. Click **Create** to create your application
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OAuth settings">
    1. After creating your application, click **Edit** for the app you just created
    2. In the **Redirect URI** section, add: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
    3. Click **Save** to save your changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your credentials">
    1. In your application settings, you'll find:
       - **API Key (Client ID)**: This is your `client_id` for OAuth requests
    2. Click **Generate Client Secret** to create your client secret
    3. Copy and save both the **API Key (Client ID)** and **Client Secret** securely. You'll need them when configuring the integration in Nango.
    
    <Warning>The client secret is only shown once when generated. Make sure to copy and save it immediately.</Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to connect your first account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## OAuth scopes

When configuring your OAuth app, you'll need to specify which scopes your app requires. For a complete list of available OAuth scopes and the endpoints they enable, see [Constant Contact's Authorization Scopes Overview](https://developer.constantcontact.com/api_guide/scopes.html).
