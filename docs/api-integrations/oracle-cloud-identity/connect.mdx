# Overview

To authenticate with Oracle Cloud Identity using the Client Credentials grant type, you will need:
1. **IDCS Service Instance** - Your Oracle Identity Cloud Service instance identifier.
2. **Client ID** - A key that is used to identify your Oracle Cloud Identity application.
3. **Client Secret** - A secret key used in conjunction with the Client ID to grant Nango permission to access Oracle Cloud Identity's API resources and services.

This guide will walk you through finding these within Oracle Cloud Identity.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have an Oracle Cloud Identity account with administrative access.
- You must have the ability to access Oracle Cloud Services in your IDCS console.

### Instructions:

### Step 1: Finding Your Service Instance

Your Oracle Identity Cloud Service instance identifier is part of your IDCS URL. It typically follows the format:

```
https://<service-instance>.identity.oraclecloud.com
```

For example, if your IDCS URL is:
```
https://idcs-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef.identity.oraclecloud.com
```

Then your service instance is: `idcs-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef`

1. Log in to your Oracle Identity Cloud Service (IDCS).

2. Access the IDCS Admin console.

### Step 2: Get the OAuth Client ID and Client Secret

1. From your account, select the **Navigation** icon (☰) to view a list of available functions.

2. Select **Oracle Cloud Services**.

3. From the Oracle Cloud Services window, select the required **FCCM Internal Application Service** (in `AMLCS <tenant-id>` format) from the list.

   <Note>
   If you are retrieving the ERP ESS Job Details API, select the required **AMLCS Application Service** (in `AMLCS <tenant-id>` format) from the list. Ensure you use the same `AMLCS <tenant-id>` when generating the access token.
   </Note>

4. Click the **Configuration** tab.

5. The **Client ID** and **Client Secret** details are displayed in the **General Information** section.

1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Oracle Cloud Identity.
2. Enter your **IDCS Service Instance**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** in their respective fields. 
3. Submit the form, and you should be successfully authenticated.
