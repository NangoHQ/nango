This guide shows you how to register your own app with Jira to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Jira account.

## Creating an OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Atlassian developer account">
    If you don't already have one, sign up for an [Atlassian developer account](https://id.atlassian.com/signup/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app">
    1. Go to the [Atlassian Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/).
    2. Click **Create** and select **OAuth 2.0 integration**.
    3. Enter a name, agree to Atlassian's developer terms by checking the agreement checkbox for your app and click **Create**.
    4. Your app will be created and you'll be taken to the app management page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OAuth 2.0 (3LO)">
    1. In the left sidebar, select **Authorization**.
    2. Next to OAuth 2.0 (3LO), click **Add**.
    3. Enter `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` as the **Callback URL**.
    4. Click **Save Changes** to save your changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add API permissions">
    1. In the left sidebar, select **Permissions**.
    2. Find the Jira API and click **Add**, and then click **Configure**.
    3. Click **Edit Scopes** then select the [scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/#scopes) your application requires. For reference, see the common scopes table below.
    4. Click **Save** to save your changes.

    <Note>Refreshing tokens requires the `offline_access` scope. Make sure to include it when configuring your integration in Nango.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain your client credentials">
    1. In the left sidebar, select **Settings**.
    2. Note your **Client ID**.
    3. Copy both the **Client ID** and **Secret** by clicking the copy buttons next to them, as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your app available to users">
    1. In the left sidebar, select **Distribution**.
    2. In **Distribution controls**, click the **Edit** button, select the **Sharing** radio button, enter a **Privacy Policy URL** and then click the **Save changes** button.
   <Note>By default, your app is private and can only be used by you. Making it public allows other users to authorize your app. Learn more about [distributing OAuth 2.0 apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/#distributing-your-oauth-2-0--3lo--apps).</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Scopes

| Scope | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| read:jira-user | Read user information |
| read:jira-work | Read Jira work items (issues, projects, etc.) |
| write:jira-work | Create and update Jira work items |
| delete:jira-work |  Delete issues |
| manage:jira-project |  Manage project settings |
| manage:jira-configuration |  Manage Jira instance settings |
| offline_access | Access to refresh tokens for offline access |

For a complete list of available scopes, see [Jira's OAuth scopes reference](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/#scopes).

## Understanding Jira's connection model

When connecting to Jira, you have two options for specifying which Jira site to connect to:

1. **Provide a `Subdomain` during connection creation (recommended)**: This ensures your users connect to a specific Jira site.
2. **Let Nango auto-select the first available site (legacy behavior)**: If no `Subdomain` is specified, Nango will use the first site from the accessible resources API.

<Note>A single Jira OAuth token can be valid for multiple Atlassian sites. For example, the same token might grant access to both "nango-hq.atlassian.net" and "nango-test.atlassian.net". This is why specifying the `Subdomain` during connection creation is important if you need to connect to a specific site.</Note>

The connection process works as follows:
1. Nango fetches all accessible sites for the OAuth token
2. If you specified a `Subdomain`, Nango finds the matching site and sets its `cloudId`
3. If no `Subdomain` is specified, Nango uses the first available site and sets its `cloudId`
4. The selected site's `cloudId` and `subdomain` are stored in the connection configuration

## Making API requests

The `cloudId` is required to make API requests to the Jira API `v3`. Nango handles getting this automatically by matching it to your specified `subdomain` if provided, or by selecting the first available site if it is not.

You will need to construct your Nango integration's `endpoint` as follows:

```typescript
const response = await nango.get({
    endpoint: `/ex/jira/${cloudId}/rest/api/3/<endpoint>`
});
```

If you need to get the cloudId manually, you can fetch it from the accessible resources API:

```typescript
const response = await nango.get({
    endpoint: `oauth/token/accessible-resources`,
    baseUrlOverride: 'https://api.atlassian.com'
});
const cloudId = response.data[0].id;
```

## Important notes

- **Token expiration**: Refresh tokens will expire after 365 days of non-use and will expire within 90 days if the resource owner is inactive for 90 days. Make sure you call `nango.getConnection()` at least every 365 days to trigger a refresh. See [Atlassian's documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/#how-do-i-get-a-new-access-token--if-my-access-token-expires-or-is-revoked-) for more details.
- **User permissions**: When making API calls, remember that the permissions of the user who authorized your app will limit what your app can do, regardless of the scopes you've requested.
- **API versions**: The Jira REST API has different versions (v2 and v3). Make sure you're using the correct version for your needs.
