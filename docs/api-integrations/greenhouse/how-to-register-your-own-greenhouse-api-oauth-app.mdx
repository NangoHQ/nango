This guide shows you how to register your own app with Greenhouse to obtain your OAuth credentials (consumer key & consumer secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Greenhouse account.

## Registering your OAuth application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit application information to Greenhouse">
    Contact Greenhouse to register your OAuth application. You'll need to provide:
    - **Application Name**: The name of your application as it will appear in Greenhouse.
    - **Application URL**: The URL of your application.
    - **Callback URL**: Use `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
    - **Logo Image**: A 128x128 pixel image that Greenhouse will include in their permissions modal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive OAuth credentials from Greenhouse">
    After submitting your application information, Greenhouse will provide:
    - **Consumer Key**: Uniquely identifies your application.
    - **Consumer Secret**: Acts as proof of your application's identity (will be encrypted when emailed).

    <Note>The consumer secret is confidential and will be encrypted by Greenhouse for security. They'll provide decryption instructions.</Note>

    After decrypting the consumer secret, copy both the **Consumer Key** (which serves as the Client ID) and **Consumer Secret** (which serves as the Client Secret) as you'll need them when configuring your integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart).
  </Step>
</Steps>
